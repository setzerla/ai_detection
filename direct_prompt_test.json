TheB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements ofthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit onthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severefor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering thenon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrarythese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of theHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection ofnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the availableATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs searchchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameterspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collidersensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that itmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for smallor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.",

In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope.

In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels andit is not enhanced by frustration.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find that theUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect ofQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.",

Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

Two compact bodies orbiting eachother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causestheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Inthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for lowmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It hasbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be acomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOswill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHObinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitiveband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By usingevidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the populationan upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in thegalactic halo.",

These two Eupelmidaehave similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentiallytake place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacementsseveral hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is activeonly in the presence of the light.

The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, thediversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of thechannel.

As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point.

The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains evenif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massiveand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that thelocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fullynonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.",

These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz.

In the latter case, where the SVD basis is a Jacobi polynomial basis,we show that our scheme is capable of achieving rates of convergence which areoptimal in the $L_2$ case, we obtain interesting rates of convergence for other$L_p$ norms which are new (to the best of our knowledge) in the literature, andwe also give a simulation study showing that the NEED-D estimator outperformsother standard algorithms in almost all situations.",

The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electricfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in thecase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it isnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extractedfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universecan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately revealthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can beconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.",

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that geneduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degreedistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstreamregions of genes.",

There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

The measuredscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxyof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities likeluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tensionbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of theICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the mostsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from theself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When theslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show anegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshifthas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than theexpectations from self-similar model.",

Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy.

The convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of theSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

To test that statement a set of constrained N-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within theflat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrainedsimulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed forcomparison.

The local gravitational field due to all halos found within eachLV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in thesimulation. We conclude that there is no correlation between the exact and thelocal gravitational field obtained by pairwise newtonian forces between halos.Moreover, the local gravitational field is uncorrelated with the peculiarvelocities of halos. The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models.

By incorporating a conformal coupling between the scalar field and gravity, the model introduces a dynamical time-varying cosmological constant, commonly referred to as Lambda. The authors employ a theoretical framework that incorporates both classical and quantum aspects, combining the Friedmann equations with the effective action from quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Through detailed calculations and analysis, they investigate the behavior of the cosmological dynamics in the presence of the conformal coupling.

In this work, we examine the role of Landau-Lifshitz sigma-models, which are field theories describing the dynamics of magnetic materials, in the context of this duality.We focus on the inclusion of fermionic degrees of freedom within Landau-Lifshitz sigma-models and their implications for the AdS/CFT correspondence.

The electronic properties of the deformed Wigner crystal are also analyzed, unveiling intriguing features such as energy gaps and localized electronic states within the crystal structure.Furthermore, the article investigates the effect of various parameters such as dot size and electron density on the deformation and electronic properties of the Wigner crystal. It is found that both the dot size and the electron density strongly influence the degree of deformation and the energy spectrum of the crystal. Additionally, a phase diagram is constructed to illustrate the different regimes of the deformed Wigner crystal as a function of these parameters.The findings of this study shed light on the behavior of Wigner crystals in low-dimensional systems and provide valuable insights into the physics of strongly correlated electron systems. The insights gained from this research contribute to the understanding of exotic electronic phenomena in quantum dots and pave the way for potential applications in nanoscale devices and quantum computing.",

In this game, one player (the Proposer) is given a sum of money and asked to divide it with another player (the Responder). The Responder can either accept or reject the offer. If the Responder accepts, both players receive the money according to the proposed division. If the Responder rejects, both players receive nothing.In this paper, we study the evolutionary dynamics of the Ultimatum Game. We consider a population of players who play the game repeatedly and use a genetic algorithm to evolve strategies for both the Proposer and the Responder. We find that the strategies that evolve are highly dependent on the initial conditions of the population. For example, if the initial population is composed mostly of Proposers who offer a fair split of the money, then the population will evolve towards strategies that are more cooperative. However, if the initial population is composed mostly of Proposers who offer a very unfair split of the money, then the population will evolve towards strategies that are more selfish.Our results suggest that the evolution of behavior in the Ultimatum Game is a complex and dynamic process. The strategies that evolve depend not only on the payoff structure of the game, but also on the initial conditions of the population.",

The source was discovered in the XMM-Newton serendipitous source catalogue and shows a very hard X-ray spectrum that can be well described by a power-law continuum plus a relativistically blurred reflection component. The primary continuum is likely to be produced by Comptonisation in a hot corona, while the reflection component is likely to be produced by reprocessing of the primary X-rays by the accretion disc. The reflection spectrum shows a number of interesting features, including a broad iron K$\\alpha$ emission line and a Compton hump. The equivalent width of the iron line is consistent with that of other radio-quiet quasars, but the Compton hump is significantly weaker than in most other sources. This suggests that the corona in RBS1423 is optically thin, and that the accretion disc is highly ionised. The overall X-ray properties of RBS1423 are similar to those of other radio-quiet quasars, but the weakness of the Compton hump is unusual.

Recent observations, including those of structured jets and a high magnetization of the outflows, imply that the jet launching mechanism might be more complex than previously thought. We investigate how a magnetar, a highly magnetized neutron star, can drive collimated outflows that are consistent with the observational properties of GRBs.Methods:We perform axisymmetric, magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which a rapidly rotating magnetar is embedded in a stellar envelope. We systematically vary the properties of the magnetar (magnetic field strength and rotation period) and the stellar envelope (density profile and rotation rate) to study the resulting outflow properties.Results:Our simulations show that magnetar-driven bubbles can indeed produce collimated outflows with Lorentz factors of a few tens to hundreds. The outflow Lorentz factor increases with the strength of the magnetar magnetic field, while it decreases with increasing rotation period of the magnetar and with increasing density of the stellar envelope.

However, in most models, gauge mediation suffers from the little hierarchy problem: the messenger fields which mediate the interactions between the supersymmetry breaking sector and the observable sector tend to acquire large masses due to supersymmetry breaking effects. This can lead to unnaturally large contributions to the Higgs mass. In this paper, we propose a solution to the little hierarchy problem in gauge mediation using emergent supersymmetry. Emergent supersymmetry is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking which relies on the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories. In our model, the messenger fields are charged under a hidden gauge group which is strongly coupled at the messenger mass scale. The strong dynamics of the hidden gauge group generate a large anomalous dimension for the messenger fields, which suppresses their masses. This allows us to solve the little hierarchy problem and obtain a naturally light Higgs mass. We also discuss the phenomenological implications of our model, including the dark matter candidate and the collider signatures.",

One approach, followed by Polyakov, is to use a path integral approach. This approach requires the specification of a world sheet action and a measure for the path integral. Polyakov proposed an action which is proportional to the area of the world sheet and a measure which is proportional to \\(exp(−S_P[X])\\), where \\(S_P\\) is the Polyakov action.This proposal, however, runs into difficulties when the string coupling becomes strong. This is because the exponential of the Polyakov action becomes large for large values of the string coupling, which makes the path integral ill-defined.One way to deal with this problem is to use a different action for the world sheet theory. A particularly interesting alternative action is the sigma model action, which is proportional to the integral of the square root of the determinant of the induced metric on the world sheet.The sigma model action has a number of advantages over the Polyakov action. First, it is well-defined for all values of the string coupling. Second, it is conformally invariant, which means that it is invariant under changes of the metric on the world sheet. Third, it is related to string field theory, which is a perturbative approach to string theory.In this paper, we will study the sigma model action in the tensionless limit. This limit is obtained by taking the string tension to zero. In this limit, the sigma model action reduces to a two-dimensional topological field theory.We will show that the sigma model in the tensionless limit is equivalent to a particular two-dimensional topological field theory known as the Liouville theory. This equivalence will allow us to use the methods of Liouville theory to study the sigma model.",

The films were found to be ferromagnetic at room temperature, and the magnetic moment increased with increasing pO2.

The results show that the coronal hole had lower overall magnetic flux levels than the quiet region. Further analysis revealed that the magnetic flux was concentrated in smaller magnetic elements in the coronal hole compared to larger magnetic features in the quiet region. Statistical analysis of the magnetic flux density histograms for the two areas found them to have distinctly different profiles, with the coronal hole exhibiting a longer tail at lower flux densities. Potential field source surface modeling was also applied to extrapolate the magnetogram data out into the heliosphere. This allowed comparison of the open flux content between the two regions and provided insights into how their differing magnetic structures impact the generation of the fast and slow solar wind.

Using observations from the 1-meter Swedish Solar Telescope of a sunspot, we measure oscillation properties such as period and power within several example penumbral filaments and compare them to the surrounding penumbra and quiet Sun. Preliminary results suggest the amplitude and power of p-mode oscillations may be reduced within some penumbral filaments, while the periods remain similar to the surroundings. This would indicate partial absorption of the p-mode waves rather than scattering. Further analysis is needed to improve signal-to-noise and statistically characterize any modifications across a larger sample of filaments.

Beginning with the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations, the dynamical evolution of the plasma is modeled numerically as it undergoes gravitational collapse. The results show how the inclusion of electromagnetic forces alters both the dynamics and end state of the collapse compared to purely gravitational scenarios. In particular, electromagnetic repulsion acts against gravitational attraction leading to slower collapse dynamics.

Furthermore, electromagnetic field anomalies are shown to develop near the surface of the compact object.

Significant alignments were detected between multiple multipole vectors with l=2-5 and l=10-30 that are not expected from a statistically isotropic Gaussian random field.

In the first paper of this series, the rotation curve of the Milky Way was analyzed using stellar and gas kinematic tracers to constrain the distribution of dark matter in the galactic halo. This follow up study focuses specifically on using HI as a tracer to infer properties of the dark matter halo. High-resolution observations of HI emission from Milky Way galaxies provide an excellent tracer of the total gravitational potential as HI is dynamically cold and extended throughout the disk. A 3D HI emission cube of the Milky Way is compiled combining data from existing Milky Way HI surveys to construct the most complete map to date. The HI distribution is analyzed to derive the velocity field as a function of position.A parameterized model for the total gravitational potential is adopted including contributions from baryonic components like stars and gas as well as dark matter. The density profile and mass of the dark matter halo are free parameters which are varied to find the best fit model that reproduces the observed Hi velocity field. Additional constraints from stellar and gas kinematic tracers are also taken into account.The model is fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of the parameter space. The sampling explores a wide range of halo masses, density profiles, and halo shapes. The best fit halo is spherical with a virial mass of 0.8-1.2 ×1012 solar masses and a concentration parameter consistent with expectations from ΛCDM simulations.The analysis finds that the HI rotation curve provides strong independent constraints on the dark matter halo properties. The results are consistent with those of the first paper and help confirm the presence of a massive dark matter halo surrounding the Milky Way.",

Through theoretical modeling and simulation of quantum many-body systems, we identify conditions under which the particles can form a coherent state without reaching full thermal equilibrium. The proposed \"thermalized non-equilibrated\" state maintains aspects of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior and correlations. We find that the interplay between coherent quasiparticle dynamics and incoherent relaxation processes in this regime can give rise to an unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism at surprisingly high temperatures.

This paper explores the concept of directed star arboricity as a theoretical bound on the number of edge-disjoint directed stars in a network. A directed star is defined as a root vertex with directed edges to leaves. We analyze the directed star arboricity of general directed graphs and establish computationally efficient algorithms to determine this property.

Specifically, we prove that the minimum number of wavelengths needed for any valid lightpath configuration in a WDM network is equal to the directed star arboricity of its underlying request graph.Through simulation on both synthetic and real-world network topologies, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms for computing directed star arboricity can be used to approximate the minimum number of wavelengths required. This provides insights to network operators on lightpath provisioning and wavelength assignment.In summary, this work establishes directed star arboricity as a useful graph-theoretic metric for the analysis of lightpath routing in WDM optical networks.

The simulations are performed using a pseudospectral method, and the results are analyzed using a wavelet-based technique.The study shows that the turbulence spectrum exhibits a power-law behavior with a slope that steepens with increasing time. The spectral index is found to depend on the plasma temperature and density, with higher temperatures and lower densities resulting in steeper spectra. The simulation also reveals the presence of a dissipation range at high wave numbers, which is attributed to the presence of small-scale turbulence.The study further investigates the effect of varying the plasma gradient scale on the turbulence spectrum. The results show that increasing the gradient scale leads to a shallower spectral index, indicating a shift towards larger-scale turbulence.

We find that the advective-acoustic cycle, which involves the interaction between fluid advection and acoustic waves, is an important mechanism for energy transport in the supernova core. Our results suggest that the advective-acoustic cycle can have a significant impact on the neutrino signal and the nucleosynthesis process in the supernova.

Firstly, the introduction of Dark Energy, a mysterious and unobserved form of energy, violates the fundamental principles of physics. Secondly, the arbitrary nature of Dark Energy's properties, such as its sudden appearance and unchanging density, undermines the scientific method and our ability to understand the universe. Thirdly, the reliance on Dark Energy to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe has stifled innovation and the development of alternative, more plausible theories. Fourthly, the focus on Dark Energy has distracted from the study of other cosmological phenomena, such as the nature of matter and the formation of galaxies. Fifthly, the promotion of Dark Energy has led to the suppression of debate and the marginalization of alternative viewpoints, damaging the scientific community's integrity. Sixthly, the acceptance of Dark Energy has resulted in a lack of investment in experiments and observations that could challenge its validity. Seventhly, the teaching of Dark Energy as established fact, rather than speculative theory, has misled a generation of students and limited their understanding of the universe. Finally, the persistence of the Dark Energy paradigm has contributed to a wider public disillusionment with science and its ability to provide meaningful answers to fundamental questions.

Our results show that the algorithm's complexity can vary significantly depending on these factors, and that it can be quite high in some cases.We also compare the complexity of Villamayor's algorithm with that of other algorithms for computing the primary decomposition of monomial ideals, such as the Buchberger-M\\\"olter algorithm and the Hibi-Matsumura algorithm. Our results show that while Villamayor's algorithm has a simpler theoretical complexity, its practical performance can be worse than that of the other algorithms in some cases.Our findings have important implications for the choice of algorithm for computing the primary decomposition of monomial ideals in different situations. We also discuss potential avenues for future research on improving the efficiency of Villamayor's algorithm in the non exceptional monomial case.Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of Villamayor's algorithm and its limitations in the non exceptional monomial case, and provide insights that can be useful for practitioners and researchers working in the field of computational commutative algebra.",

We utilized Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) observations to investigate the properties of BS 90 and its surrounding environment. The ACS data provide high-resolution imaging capabilities that allow us to study the cluster's structure and color properties in detail. We found that BS 90 has a age of approximately 200 million years, which places it in the intermediate-age range between young and old clusters. The cluster's color-magnitude diagram reveals a clear red giant branch, which suggests that the cluster has undergone significant evolution since its formation. We also identified a number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, which are likely to be the precursors of planetary nebulae. The spatial distribution of the stars in BS 90 shows a centrally concentrated distribution, indicative of a dynamically evolved cluster. Moreover, we found that the cluster's morphology is consistent with a mass of approximately 10^4 solar masses. The study of BS 90 provides valuable insights into the star formation history of the SMC and the evolution of intermediate-age clusters. The results of this study can be used to inform future research on the formation and evolution of star clusters in external galaxies.",

Our sample consists of 12 quasars, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and followed up with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We detected millimeter and radio emission from all 12 quasars, with luminosities ranging from 10^26 to 10^28 W Hz^(-1). The millimeter and radio spectra show a range of shapes, with some quasars exhibiting flat or even slightly inverted spectra, while others show steep spectra. We interpret these observations in the context of quasar evolution and find that the flat-spectrum sources are likely to be young, recently triggered quasars, while the steep-spectrum sources are older, more evolved quasars. Our results provide new insights into the early stages of quasar evolution and highlight the importance of multi-wavelength observations in understanding the growth and development of supermassive black holes.",

The model is based on a combination of plasticity and damage mechanics, allowing for the simulation of both the material's plastic deformation and damage evolution. The model is validated through a series of experiments, including uniaxial compression tests and finite element simulations. The results show that the proposed model accurately predicts the material's behavior under various loading conditions, including those that result in damage. The model's ability to capture the material's anisotropic behavior is particularly notable, as it can accurately predict the differences in mechanical properties between the principal directions. The proposed model has important implications for the design and analysis of concrete structures, as it can help engineers better understand and predict the material's behavior under various loading conditions. Future research directions include further validation of the model under different loading conditions and the development of new experimental techniques to measure the material's properties in principal directions.",

Using a sample of 100 F and G dwarfs within 20 parsecs of the Sun, we measure the stellar velocity components in the Galactic Cartesian coordinates and compute the age of each star using stellar evolution models. We find that the velocity field of F and G dwarfs changes significantly with age, with younger stars exhibiting higher velocities in the direction of Galactic rotation. We also find that the velocity dispersion of F and G dwarfs decreases with age, indicating that these stars become more settled in their orbits as they age. Our results suggest that the velocity field of F and G dwarfs can be used as a clock to estimate the age of these stars, which can be useful for studying the history and evolution of the Milky Way galaxy. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the stellar populations in the solar neighborhood and the role of galactic dynamics in shaping the velocity field of stars.",

Our results show that third dredge-up leads to an enhancement of carbon and nitrogen at the surface, while hot-bottom burning increases the abundance of oxygen and reduces that of sodium. We also find that the abundance patterns in these stars are influenced by mass loss and metallicity. The presence of a planetary companion can additionally affect the surface abundances through the process of binary interaction.

We also examine the ways in which racism intersects with other forms of oppression, such as classism and sexism, to create complex systems of discrimination. The article highlights the need for a critical race theory that acknowledges the intersectionality of oppressions and seeks to dismantle the systems of power that perpetuate them. We argue that a physicist's perspective on racism can offer valuable insights into the ways in which social and political structures shape our understanding of race and can inform strategies for combating racism in the scientific community and beyond.

Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.Markit said last year's Brexit vote was also driving some EU nationals home, making it harder to fill a wide variety of jobs.",

Historic England's research is only the tip of the iceberg as it's almost impossible to trace what has happened to every piece of public art since 1945.\"We're making efforts to protect the best examples of post-war public art that still exist, and make sure that it continues to enhance the public realm.\"But we also want to raise awareness of just how vulnerable these works can be and we want the public to help us track down lost pieces.\"Henry Moore's Reclining Figure that was stolen from Hertfordshire in 2005 was worth £3m but police believe it was probably melted down and sold for scrap metal for £1,500.Others have been vandalised, including an abstract steel sculpture by Barry Flanagan in Cambridge.Historic England believes public art is under threat because of the price of scrap metal, local authority funding gaps, pressure from redevelopment and vandalism.In 2012, Wakefield Council removed its Henry Moore sculpture from public display and put it in secure storage because of a spate of thefts.",

And if it was \"legal\", well that is OK then, even if Prime Minister David Cameron says it was \"morally wrong\".Unfortunately, tax is a bit more complicated than that.Tax evasion is the illegal thing. It happens when people deliberately do not pay the tax they should. It is criminal.Tax avoidance is the arrangement of a taxpayer's affairs in such a way as to pay the least amount of tax legitimately.A fine line? Some would say so.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is referring to K2 in the category of tax avoidance, so let us concentrate on that.Just because a scheme is classed as tax avoidance does not mean it is all right.Usually, it has to be registered with HMRC, so they can check if it complies with tax rules.If HMRC decides it is not acceptable, then the taxpayer would have to hand over all the unpaid tax along with interest and, possibly, penalties.Basically, officials treat the underpayment of tax as a mistake.It could be that the scheme takes advantage of some obscure loophole. In that case the tax people would get the Treasury to change the law, but the scheme's users would get away scot free until such an order was made.So the Jimmy Carr ruse is not being talked about by the authorities as illegal, but that does not mean he - and the others who are or were signed up to it - will not have to pay back the tax.HMRC's line is that K2 is being investigated.Another phrase being bandied about is \"tax abuse\" which, confusingly, can be applied to both evasion and avoidance.A tax avoidance scheme which HMRC finds to be a blatantly artificial construction to dodge tax could be an abuse.There will soon be a            General Anti-Abuse Rule to deter this sort of dodging. Some accountants say it will \"kill it stone dead\", others that it will just lead to more complicated disputes.",

It's a sort of benign tumour,\" Dr Dhiware said.\"At first, we couldn't cut it out so we had to use the basic chisel and hammer to take it out.\"Once we opened it, little pearl-like teeth started coming out, one-by-one. Initially, we were collecting them, they were really like small white pearls. But then we started to get tired. We counted 232 teeth,\" she added.The surgery, conducted on Monday, involved two surgeons and two assistants. The team was led by Dr Vandana Thorawade who heads the hospital's ENT (ear, nose and throat) department. Ashik now has 28 teeth.Describing Ashik's case as \"very rare\", Dr Dhiware said she had \"not seen anything like this before in my 30-year career\", but said she was \"thrilled to get such an exciting case\".\"According to medical literature available on the condition, it is known to affect the upper jaw and a maximum of 37 teeth have been extracted from the tumour in the past. But in Ashik's case, the tumour was found deep in the lower jaw and it had hundreds of teeth.\"Ashik's father Suresh Gavai was quoted by the Mumbai Mirror as saying that his son complained of severe pain a month ago.\"I was worried that it may turn out to be cancer so I brought him to Mumbai,\" he said.",

However, quarterly radio listening figures have a habit of bouncing around.Look over the long term and what's surprising is that in an era of huge technological change, radio listening has stayed so stable overall.In March 2006, Radio 1 had a weekly reach of 9.9 million listeners aged over 15. In March 2016, it had 9.9 million.However, there are trends hidden in the figures.The number of hours that 15-24 year-olds listen to radio has gone from 29 million hours in 2010 to 16 million in 2016.That young audience has dropped from 3.7 million (45%) to 2.9 million (36%).But why do people care so much about Radio 1's figures?The BBC worries about it because it is their most successful youth brand and the corporation as a whole struggles to reach young people.The external attention is harder to fathom. The era of Radio 1 being the most listened-to radio station passed long ago.The big shift has not been the decline of Radio 1, it has been the rise of Radio 2. In 1999, Radio 2 had 9.6 million listeners - it now has 15.5 million.Radio 1's success in the 1970s and 80s means that the middle-aged people who are avid consumers of news retain an interest in the one bit of youth culture that they still recognise.Indeed, Radio 1 has 4.1 million listeners over the age of 35 - and around 800,000 of them are over the age of 60.It is worth noting that this 4.1 million figure hasn't changed much, even though BBC 6Music - which is aimed at this older audience - has seen its reach go from 200,000 to 1.4 million.Around 11 million hours of Radio 1's listening is by people over the age of 45. The problem for Radio 1 is that today's generation gap is more about the way we consume music than the music itself.No wonder Radio 1's press release wants to point out how many hits the station's channel is getting on YouTube.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

It has been just five years since IBM's Roadrunner became the first computer to break the 1 petaflop/s mark. That machine was shut down in 2013 due to excessive power consumption.The entire top 500 list of supercomputers combined offered 274 petaflop/s.Tianhe-2 is owned by the Chinese government and operated by the National University of Defence Technology.

One was given a life sentence; the other 21 years in jail.Abu Khdair, 16, was forced into a car, then beaten and burned alive.The court says 31-year-old Yosef Haim Ben David led the attack, but it is yet to rule if he was mentally competent.Abu Khdair was killed in apparent revenge for the murders of three Israeli teens in the West Bank.The killings were part of an escalating cycle of violence, culminating in a war between Israel and militants in Gaza.Mohammad Abu Khdair's body was found in a forest in West Jerusalem on 2 July 2014, two days after the bodies of the Israeli teenagers abducted and murdered by Hamas militants that June were found.In November, the Jerusalem District Court found that Ben David and the two youths had abducted the Palestinian at random as he stood on a road in East Jerusalem.The youths then beat him unconscious in the back of a car being driven by Ben David, the judges said. One of the youths helped douse him with petrol while he was still alive, before Mr Ben David lit a match and set him on fire, they added.The two youths confessed to the abduction in court, though one testified that he was not involved in the killing. Mr Ben David chose not to testify.The judges found that Ben David, who was portrayed as the ringleader, had participated in the abduction and murder. But they said a formal verdict would be postponed until a psychiatric evaluation had been carried out.Following Thursday's sentencing hearing, Israeli state prosecutor Ori Korb said: \"The sentence imposed on the defendants reflects what we asked for and the barbaric and atrocious act.\"But Mohammad Abu Khdair's father, Hussein, told reporters that the family would appeal against the lesser sentence given to one of the youths.The case has been closely watched by Palestinians who often claim of prejudice in Israel's justice system, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem reports.",

The army said an unknown number of people were missing.There had been concerns over the safety of the site in Colombo, with residents demanding it be cleared.The AFP news agency said about 800 tonnes of waste were added to the Meethotamulla dump every day, and that the government had planned to remove it.\"We heard a massive sound. It was like thunder,\" one resident, Kularathna, told the Reuters news agency. \"Tiles in our house got cracked. Black water started coming in.\"The collapse occurred as many people were marking Aluth Avurudda, or the Sinhalese New Year, a major public holiday across Sri Lanka.Emergency officials told the BBC that up to 20 people may remain buried in their houses, with the Sri Lankan army now co-ordinating the recovery.One disaster emergency official told AFP the death toll would have been higher had many people not left their homes after the fire at the dump, hours before the collapse.One government minister, Harsha De Silva, said in a statement that no more rubbish would be dumped at the site, and would instead be placed in two other sites.It is not clear when the decision is made. Footage filmed by the BBC on Saturday showed people continuing to dump rubbish at Meethotamulla.Mr De Silva said residents had been advised to leave because of the risk of landslides.\"It's unfortunate that even though payments had been made for those families under risk of landslides to move out some had not done so. They had even been advised to leave as recently as two days ago,\" he said.Last month, a landslide at a rubbish dump in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killed at least 113 people.",

One high-profile leader is monk Ashin Wirathu, who recently used abusive language to describe the UN's special envoy to Myanmar.In December, the UN passed a resolution urging Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) to give access to citizenship for the Rohingya, many of whom are classed as stateless.",

Also there will be questions around the transport infrastructure in the area as well.\"I'm always keen for people to think of the local area when it comes to the possibility for more employment... but it's got to be sensitive and in keeping with the area and it has to have a strong level of local support for me.\"Mr Broome took control of Alton Towers in the 1970s, turning it into a major theme park before selling to the Tussauds Group in 1990.",

The island, known for its tight-knit community and local governance, requires a specific number of individuals to volunteer for positions within the parish. However, it appears that enthusiasm for this vital aspect of community service is dwindling.Local authorities are expressing their concerns as the deadline for candidate applications approaches. The shortage of interested candidates raises questions about the future of effective and efficient governance in the Guernsey parish. The need for active participation in parish politics cannot be overstated, as these dedicated individuals play a pivotal role in decision-making processes that directly impact the lives of community members.The reasons behind this apparent lack of interest remain uncertain. Some speculate that the younger generation may be more preoccupied with other commitments, while others believe there is a larger societal trend of disengagement in local affairs. The implications of reduced engagement in Guernsey's parish politics could have far-reaching consequences for the overall well-being of the community.Efforts are now underway to encourage and educate potential candidates about the importance and impact they can have by actively participating in local governance.

After carefully considering the evidence presented, the jury found the former educator not guilty of the charges, leading to his acquittal.The case had been closely watched by the local community and sparked discussions about the protection of minors and the responsibilities of educational institutions towards their students.

Taking inspiration from the Wild West era, the PSNI has announced plans to post Wild West-style pictures of no-show suspects on its official Facebook page.The unconventional approach comes in response to the increasing challenge of securing the presence of individuals summoned to court. By publicly displaying these images, the PSNI hopes to raise awareness among the community and encourage citizens to provide any information that could assist in locating the absconding suspects.The Wild West-style pictures, reminiscent of most-wanted posters from a bygone era, will feature the names and details of individuals who have breached their legal obligations by skipping court appearances. The hope is that this eye-catching method will generate public interest and prompt individuals to come forward with any relevant tips or sightings.By leveraging the power of social media, the PSNI aims to harness its broad reach and engage the public in actively contributing to the administration of justice. The move reflects a growing trend, as law enforcement agencies worldwide use social media platforms to solve crimes and foster collaboration with their communities.However, critics argue that this Wild West-style approach may inadvertently lead to vigilante action or unsubstantiated public shaming. Amidst these concerns, the PSNI emphasizes that the initiative is intended solely to enlist public support and cooperation, encouraging all tips to be reported directly to the police authorities.With this new initiative, the PSNI hopes to send a strong message to potential offenders and reaffirm its commitment to maintaining law and order in Northern Ireland.",

Lisa Jones, 35, of Aberystwyth was driving home from work on June 3rd when another vehicle crossed into her lane. Police said the other driver, Thomas Evans, had a blood alcohol level three times over the legal limit at the time of the crash. Lisa sadly passed away at the scene from her injuries as a result of the high-speed head-on collision. Thomas Evans pled guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to 5 years in prison. However, Lisa's family believes the current guidelines are too lenient and do not properly punish those who make the reckless decision to drink and drive. \"She had her whole life ahead of her and it was taken away in an instant by someone's selfish actions,\" said Lisa's mother Margaret Thompson. The family is now campaigning to double the maximum sentence to 10 years for cases involving death by dangerous driving due to alcohol intoxication. They started an online petition which has already received over 5,000 signatures in support. Members of Parliament in the area have also backed the call for sentencing reform. A decision on whether guidelines will be reviewed is expected later this year. Lisa's family hopes their efforts will help deter drink driving and seek justice for victims of such irresponsible crimes.",

Steinbrueck, who serves as the former finance minister, was attending a campaign event in Hannover when he made the offensive sign to photographers. Video footage quickly emerged on social media showing the SPD leader extending his middle finger below the podium. The gesture prompted swift backlash from his political rivals. Members of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party condemned Steinbrueck's behavior as \"crass and inappropriate\" for a man hoping to become Germany's next leader.

The disturbing event took place in a school in the state of Gujarat, and has sparked widespread outrage and disbelief.According to reports, the incident occurred on November 26th, when the girls were taken to a bathroom and forced to strip off their clothes by school staff. The staff then proceed to check the girls' underwear for menstrual blood, under the pretext of ensuring they were following proper hygiene practices.The investigation was launched after a complaint was filed by a local NGO, who were informed of the incident by some of the affected girls. The NGO has accused the school of violating the girls' rights and dignity, and has demanded strict action against the guilty parties.So far, three teachers and the school's principal have been suspended pending the investigation. The education department has also issued a show-cause notice to the school, demanding an explanation for the incident.The incident has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many calling for stricter laws and harsher punishment for those who commit such atrocities. Others are demanding increased awareness and education about menstruation, to help break down the stigmas and taboos surrounding the natural biological process.The Gujarat government has promised to take strict action against those responsible, and has assured the public that the matter is being treated with the seriousness it deserves.This incident is a stark reminder of the deep-seated societal attitudes that perpetuate gender-based violence and discrimination against women and girls in India. It highlights the need for greater awareness, education, and policy changes to protect the rights and dignity of women, particularly in the context of menstruation.",

The medal was awarded to John Smith, a 95-year-old veteran who served in the Royal Navy during World War II. Smith was part of the crew of a landing craft that ferried soldiers to the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944. Despite facing heavy enemy fire, Smith continued to navigate his craft and ensure the safe landing of the soldiers. His bravery and selflessness that day have been recognized with the Norwegian Medal of Honour, which is awarded to individuals who have demonstrated exceptional courage and heroism in the face of danger. The medal is given by the Norwegian government and is considered one of the country's highest honors. Smith is proud to have received the award and hopes that his story will inspire future generations to never forget the sacrifices made during the war.",

All that was left was a crater filled with the liquefied remains of skyscrapers. We were left to wonder who did it, because we did n' t yet know of our Watchers. About 18 months later, every show on every channel was interrupted. An almost reptilian face came into focus. Its scales were green, and it had intricate orange designs painted onto its face. It cleared its throat, and I remember I was shocked because I knew it was about to speak. Without an introduction or any decorum, it began, \" Thou humans shall surrender on the 4th of July, or thou shalt face utter extinction. Thou shalt meet our generals at the ruins of your great city of New York, and there surrender yourselves into servitude. \" No one ever knew why the reptile spoke that way. I hypothesized later that they had been watching us for hundreds of years and somehow learned archaic English, but I had no way to be sure. The 4th of July came and went, and there was no sign of the great retribution we were promised. January 1, 2048: the land invasion began. The East and West coasts were both overwhelmed over the course of six months until humanity began to fight in earnest. We had begun the war with the weapons humanity had for hundreds of years: firearms that shot metal rounds, bombs, missiles, all weapons that depended on piercing a hard exterior to get to the flesh inside. One year after the invasion began, the US Army issued plasma rifles to every able-bodied human in the Heartland. They were almost the exact weapon the reptilian aliens used, but more ergonomic for human use. These weapons allowed humanity to create a fragile stalemate with the Watchers. *To Be Continued... * ( when I have time )",

A dozen or so familiar faces — Zorxx the Great, High Priest of the Poinsai Beta star system; Derns the Fierce, Intergalactic Warlord of Epsilon 9; and Sol, Elder of a system so distant, it remains nameless — among others. The ceremony was to begin shortly. As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6, the Lottery was to be pulled on this date. Nature has a funny way. It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution. At the last ceremony, Earth was chosen by the prophet. And at the ceremony before that. Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries. It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council. The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old. Every 2000 suns, the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet. The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life. The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant. \" Civilizations crumble, People cry, Many will suffer, Many will die, Life is a blessing, But also a curse, Given this knowledge, Who knows which is worse? \" The Prophet began its process. It said nothing. Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber. Faces grew grim. At the rise of the New Sun, the fleets would be dispatched, and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born. One planet was chosen to grow. It was n' t Earth.",

Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend. Do not worry about the teapot you broke, or the squirrels you accidentally fried. I believe in you. You can be a great wizard.",

Each person eagerly awaited their transformation. As the moon reached its apex, slowly, everyone began to change. Skin grew hairier, teeth grew sharper, eyes grew wilder. Everyone began changing into the spirit animals they saw in their visions. Well, everyone except me, that is. As my friends changed into wolves, eagles, bears, snakes, they all saw that I retained my human form. A few laughed at me and mocked for being stuck in this pitiful existence. Some pitied me for not being able to experience the new freedom and strength that came with a new form. Others looked at me with revulsion, and considered me unworthy and unclean. One by one, as each one completed the transformation, they slipped into the night. The old lady shook her head at me and sighed, suggesting that perhaps I did n' t pray hard enough. Her eyes were filled with frustration and pity. Yes, I' ll try again next year; yes, I' ll bring a better offering; yes, I' ll pray more fervently; and all that stuff. I ca n' t say that I was too disappointed by my lack of transformation, though. I was n' t exactly distressed. I *am* a shapeshifter, after all.",

The pentagram painted in panda blood flickered the reflection of the many candles around the room. 666 red candles made from the earwax of goats. I had been looking forward to this ever since I was a child and watched little nicky, the idea that Satan was n' t as evil as he appeared had stuck with me for 20 years. Now I was about to find out if it was true. I recited the spell. shadows filled the room and swirled around the ground and up the walls. circling in a demonic dance, moving faster and faster. suddenly darkness took the room and smoke from the newly extinguished candles filled my nostrils. There was a red glow at the center of the room, but i couldnt quite make out what it was. some sort of vapor had filled the basement and I was having a hard time seeing. as the smoke started to settle. I saw it, a slightly glowing silhouette of a big man. he started to move, and as he moved closer i could tell that his belly was big, and his cheeks were flushed. his white beard reaching almos to his belly button. he wore a red coat that shimmered with a dull red glow, and he wore a crown made of deer antlers and chirstmas tree branches. He had a twinkle in his eye that just said *everything is ok* I said \" who are you? \" and the man replied \" I have many names. but the one you would be most familiar with is santa \" his warm voice vibrated in my ears as if he were speaking through a silky and soothing jazz tune. his eyes twinkled as he spoke to me. I questioned him further \" well, how did you get here? \" without even a slight pause he asked \" do you trust me, son? \" well I suppose I do n' t have a reason not to, you are santa after all. \" he pulled me close, gave me a big hug and whispered softly in my ear \" thats good, son. because the only way i can steal your soul is if you trust me. \"",

For the past year I have been delivering for Smitty' s Pizza Hut to get the extra cash I need for my tuition bill. I' ve already submitted my two week notice and this is my last day, in fact my last delivery before moving back home to California. The sound of the door bell has a very odd sound. It chimed three times with one press of the bell. I began to reach for the doorbell again before I heard the foot steps. It sounds like a heavy set person. Maybe this customer does n' t need this delivery. The door opened slowly with a very audible creak before revealing a man wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and a very cartoonish Ronald Reagan mask. \" Nice mask bro. Here' s your pizza. That' ll be $ 18. 72. \" The man just stood there staring at me. He had a very foul smell about him and I could very easily hear heavy breathing. Thank goodness he' s wearing that mask. I bet this guys breath smells about as bad as the stench emitting from what is more than likely an unbathed body. \" It' s $ 18. 72. You want this pizza or not? \" I shifted my weight and my gaze was caught at the scene that was beyond him. A woman and two children were tied to chairs with make shift gags of cloth in their mouths. The cloth in the woman' s mouth was drenched and had spittle being flung around as she violently shook her head trying to do what I can very easily assume was scream for help. That was when I noticed the gun. It was firmly gripped in the hand of the man standing before me pointed downwards. It was then that the man finally spoke his first words. \" You' re just in time for the party. \" As he rose the gun to my face I felt my entire body begin to freeze. The boxes fell from my hands and landed hard on the ground. \" Pick that up and come inside. Everyone is going to need to be fed if were going to have a fun night. \"",

For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet. As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent.

By morning, all around the world, people rejoiced at the destruction they had caused. Poe became ashes shoved up a chimney, Carroll fell down the rabbit hole never to return, and Lovecraft became nothing but a myth.

Nevertheless, we had the runes translated ( a good thousand of them! ) and sent back home. Society immediately put them to good use. It was like we' d all been given plentiful amounts of magic. Our civilization prospered on our new-found powers, which made our lives sooo much easier. I now realize that we really should n' t have transmitted the information at all. We forgot that even with power limitations there' s always another way of abusing abilities. Namely, quantity. When it comes to tattoos, surface area is the now the most valuable resource.

And new souls were quite... unpredictable. You did n' t like using them. The art of weaving new souls had been long lost. Nobody thought there ever would be need for more. 10 billion souls had been such a ridiculous amount to begin with, so to think that wouldn' t be enough was talk for lunatics, not for sensible ministry men. But humans had managed to surprise you all. Perhaps the celestial body they were on would give out before the limit would be reached. Perhaps there would be another asteroid. Perhaps there would be a new plague. More wars. But it was all just wishful thinking. The humans had shown tremendous capabilities to survive from things meant to be their doom. To your annoyance. Slicing souls into two, sometimes three or even four, pieces had become a sort of a sience experiment for you. Humans were always so excited when they got identical offsprings, so it had been a win win situation. Of course when you recycled the soul as one later on, you got some side effects, but they were still viable souls and it had given you more time. But now it was impossible to postpone the decision. You were out of tricks. It was excitement you felt rather than despair. Your burden would be finally taken away from you and perhaps something new and better would come out of this last action of yours. You pick the last of the new souls with you. No more for Earth.

He' d never gone skydiving before. What if the parachute did n' t open and he died? Or you can do something like this: > He shuffled around in the small hold of the plane until one of the instructors finally told him to \" please sit down, sir. \" He' d already chewed his nails down to the quick, so now he was tapping his fingers against his knee, adjusting the zipper on the jumpsuit, triple-checking the parachute; anything to keep his mind off the near future: plummeting head-first from thirty-thousand feet, with the ground rushing up and no protection except a flimsy sheet that might not even work. He never should have let Ellen talk him into going skydiving. Sure it might cure his fear of heights -- by reducing him to nothing more than a splatter of blood and guts on the pavement, a victim of faulty equipment. Sure, it takes more words, but it' s often more effective to describe a character' s actions in relation to their emotions than to simply say \" He was elated. \" Even something as simple as \" A huge grin broke across his face \" can communicate the same thing without serving it to the reader on a silver platter. This is n' t saying that you need to be mysterious, it' s simply saying that you do n' t need to directly tell the reader \" Look at my character, see how he feels! \"",

The curtains had been drawn, shielding passersby from the horrific scene inside.

With trembling fingers he collected $ 200 from his equally nervous mother. He rolled again and landed on Chance. He picked up a Get Out of Jail Free card. The game continued, observed closely by the burglar. He sat in an armchair beside the family, his gun resting on his knee, eyes fixed on the board. Finally, after six hours of intense playing, the mother had brought her children and husband to bankruptcy and won the game. Houses and hotels were scattered across the board. A fistful of $ 500 bills were clenched in her hands. She wiped the sweat from her brow and gazed at the burglar. He had leaned back in the armchair. \" Hmm... \" he began pensively. \" I thought it would end differently. Oh well, now I know.

Today was the day of the big meeting, so I drove directly to the office, bypassing my usual stop at the coffee shop.

Ughh, I went down to the bathroom to try and clean this mess before it set in too bad. I slipped out of my pants and started wiping the spots with wet paper towels.

On an average day, I fight 15 hooligans, save 10 civilians and drink 5 cups of coffee. However, this day was... different. I remember having woken up 10 seconds, before the boisterous sounds of my alarm. I quickly combed my hair, packed my bag, and rushed out the door. After having walked out the door, I shoved my bag into the ill-fitting trunk of my red 1986 Toyota Tercel. Once I had disposed off my bag, I slid onto the front corduroy seat and drove off for my doctor' s appointment It was there, that I had pleasantly taken a seat on the lounge chairs and was waiting to be called for my appointment with Dr. Simons. Thats when it happened. I was comfortably lying on the chair, when the brown mahogany table next to me began to shake..... 10 seconds, thud thud thud thud. It was getting closer...... 9 seconds, my hands juxtaposed against my body...... 8 seconds, a man in a dark kevlar vest began to approach me..... 7 seconds, I ran towards the man in full speed, in attempt to get a hold of his firearm..... 6 seconds, he skillfully maneuvered around my attack and began to fire at me.....

I have a magical control problem. Whenever I cast a spell, there' s enough mana leak that a cinnamon roll appears. I ca n' t eat them all, they attract rodents, and selling them would crash the local economy. What to do? Well, you could destroy it with magic. Which is a spell. Which summons another one. I spent much time writing far and wide for solutions, but one day it hit me. Why not a spell to annihilate two cinnamon rolls out of existance? It took refinement. There had to be a delay between casting and effect. I got bored of casting it, so I placed it in a self sustaining triggered loop. Eventually, I had it down. I would cast a spell, the roll would appear, triggering my second spell, triggering the second roll and then they would cease to exist with a small pop. I could live with the pop. Slightly annoying, but do you have any idea how unstable a triple mana flux triggered arrangement is? Of course not. Now, with that out of the way, we can have the rest of the memoirs proceed in peace, without asking why I published a scroll of cinnamon annhilation, why I smell faintly of cinnamon, or why my spells go' pop'.",

I pretended to be asleep and noticed how he suspiciously watched me as he took a small water bottle out of his back pack filled with a glowing neon pink fluid. He put the bottle in the fridge and started shuffling through the drawers like he was desperately looking for something. He kept looking at me every few seconds so I kept my eyes closed to avoid detection and within a few minutes I hard the door slam. I quickly rose from my bed, throwing the covers off my body and moved towards the fridge in the dark room. Just before I reached the fridge he stepped out of the dark corner towards me. He had n' t left. He looked at me with a blank stare. \" Thought you were sleeping. \" He said calmly. \" I heard the door slam it woke me up \" I said. A quick repsponse. \" Why were you heading towards the fridge. A long pause. \" What was that bottle? \" \" Why do you look so stressed out? \" He moved closer to me. Now we were face to face. Noses almost touching. He cocked his head to the side and tried to kiss me. \" What the fuck bro? \" I pushed him away. He back stepped and stumbled into the darkness again.

Indeed, that was the most embarrassing way to meet for the first time. Still, how lucky I am to be with someone like him, and he in return. His deep tones in his voice left me yearning to hear more. How can anyone not know this feeling? Elated is not even the right word. So I' m pondering what to get him. Two tickets to the movies? Or maybe surprise him by wearing that lingerie I bought. Perhaps he has something in mind. Planning this anniversary can be quite a fickle, indeed. Everything' s got to go well. Do you think these sandals match my skirt? How should I style my hair? Ugh!!

It seemed like the apocalypse had happened too late for it to have any effect. A hundred years earlier and it may have crippled humanity, now it was nothing more than another episode to be exploited by politicians to increase taxes.

Light wavered at the center of my vision, distorting my perception of the blue hospital bed fabric. Sand shifted between my toes as the cool sea gently rocked me back and forth, warm summer sun beating down on my shoulders. Instead of seagulls and waves, I heard the beeping of the heart monitor, distant and muffled. It melted into the chiming beat of the song being played by my toddler jumper as I bounced towards my mother' s open arms. Orange lights, green lights, a flash with every step. The dog' s fur brushed across my leg as the ball left my brother' s hand, arcing through the bright sky towards the trees in the back yard. A faraway whistle. The light of a flashlight cut through the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered our efforts were futile. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. The nurse passed by the bed to check the monitor. Someone' s tears dripped onto my hand as the light filled my vision again, and then I was falling – falling back into the spectrum of memories. I braced myself for the next sensation. There wasn' t one. Straining against my unraveling mind, I struggled to find a grip on my thoughts. *Was I dying? Where was I? Who was I? * The light was still there. It hungered for more. *Hungered for what --? * A feeling of intense horror sank in as I began to understand. All my memories over the course of a lifetime – the fragments that made up my identity had been siphoned away by this predatory entity that now left me with nothing, as nothing. The pressure on my hand lifted, drawing me senseless, back to the bed. I found myself staring at the tube protruding from an emaciated arm. *My arm? * I couldn' t recall. The light pulled away, disappearing along with my vision as I felt the last pulsations of my heart dwindle into nothing. Darkness enveloped my hapless soul.",

The next day featured more of the same prompts. Outwardly, the writers were elated, but more and more stories began to drift into familiar realms. A prompt based on an Einstein quote regarding time relativity was the most obvious, receiving 300 upvotes and 40 stories involving time travel, and spaceships. By day 5, every story involved some mention of Hitler, immortality or Gods. By the time Monday rolled around, the mods decided to close the subreddit.

The African Union has been threatening the Strait since Spain captured Isla de Alborán as a naval base with the backing of NATO in direct violation of the Treaty Of Tangier. The Soviet Union has been working with the U. N. as an arbitrator between the European Powers and the A.

The U. N. also hopes to resolve the fate of the stateless Boer people who were expelled out of Africa along with other European peoples from Zimbabwe and Algeria after the introduction of Cairo Accord which stripped citizenship and expelled ancestors of European colonists still living on the Continent. Currently no nation has agreed to take in ten thousand displaced people who currently reside in displaced persons camps in Brazil who have made moves to close the camps and move the people on stating \" we believe we have no responsibility to these people and that the nations that placed their ancestors in Africa should repatriate them \".

My plan was the same as every full moon, walk around the city that was beginning to encroach my forest, and I jinxed myself by believing the night would be mishap free. As it were and often is, there was another plan in place. The smell came first. While dulled, it was still sharper than most of my current-kin. Fear, especially, was potent enough to smell even among the cold smell of forest. Instinct kicked in, as I recognized it as the fear of something young.

Like the heat of the day erasing a morning snow, the void melted the living tissue into a trickle of nothingness adding to the vacuum. The feeling had consumed most of his arms and legs and had begun to encompass his head. As it delved deeper, he got progressively duller. This new sensation, much like being sleepy, caused his thoughts to come much slower than normal and made him less attuned to his situation. At this point, much of his torso had been swallowed up. The void was encircling his heart. He no longer had any knowledge of his environment; he was just a body floating in blackness.

It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated. Maybe something like \" What the fuck is wrong with you? \" *",

I know that my path is necessary, and that all the evil I' ve done has a purpose, a goal, an eventual result that will justify my actions... But when you do the wrong thing for the right reasons long enough, it seems you can justify anything. Six million people died with the first bomb. It was an improvised nuclear explosive, funded with money stolen from bank accounts across the globe. Money I personally oversaw the transfer of, a bomb I ordered the construction and detonation of, six million lives I took with my own ideas, such are the sins I will carry with me along this road. The resulting political turmoil will lead to my appointment to global anti-terrorism council, with complete support from every major government in the world. Under my direction, eventually my organization will gain total authority over every man, woman and child alive. The sheer technological and logistical costs will be unheard of in history. I will then use my power to administer a test to all humanity, and kill any who fail. 2. 3 billion people, of which over sixty percent will be completely innocent, their only crime to register a false positive. The remaining 40 will be the carriers of a long dormant virus that will, when awakened in my timeline, leadsm to the extinction of mankind. In total, I will have directly and indirectly killed two and a half billion people to save humanity. How many lives I save, I do not know. I do n' t think about that anymore.

Dogs would often end up as police officers, parrots as talk show hosts, seagulls as fishermen or naval crew. The alpacas of the world often ended up as psychopaths, which was a rather strange trait. Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He was never loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy, like those who now had finches. He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled. No more pain. For him, at least.",

He felt the rough bark, and could smell the apples that littered its branches. He reached up to grab one of the apples, to finally taste one of them when he heard a voice. \" I would n' t do that if I was you. \" Adam spun around. He had never encountered another person in the garden before. When he saw her, his jaw dropped. She was very obviously full human. She was of medium height, with long dark hair and green eyes. She approached with a steady confidence that made Adam uneasy. She reached out to pull his hand away from the tree, and as soon as her smooth skin brushed against his, Adam woke. He found himself completely nude in a patch of trees that he had never seen before. He slowly got up and started exploring, trying to figure out where he was. A fallen tree was blocking the path, and as he climbed over it he gasped. The tree from his dream was right in front of him.

The people would now be willing, if not eager, to give up their hard-won freedoms in exchange for safety and security. It was, as the saying goes, the beginning of the end. We have all sacrificed more than we would wish. We have all lost family members in the struggle for freedom. We have lost our homes. We have lost our jobs. We have lost our entire way of life. Now, I must ask you to give more. The rebellion must succeed if we are to endure as a people, and not perish from the earth. We must continue the resistance movement! We must fight! We must once again secure, for all time, our freedom! I would remind you of a quote attributed to the late President Benjamin Cartwright III. During an evacuation attempt by his bodyguards from the besieged White House, he was shot and killed by U.S. Military forces. His crime was suspicion of advocating freedom. \" My only regret is that I have but one life to give for my people. \" This is Radio Free America, signing off.",

He was going to end it right here. He would leave the world beholden to no one. He fingered the rat poison in his pocket, the only thing he could afford to off himself with. He was going to die today and he was going to die satisfied albeit a little hungry. Pressing the button for a coke, he stuck his hand into the slot and instead of the red and silver can he had anticipated, it was purple. He sighed, nothing ever goes right for him anyway, and he was used to it. At least it wasn' t anything terribly disgusting like root beer. He used to love that grape soda with aloe bits in it, it reminded him of happier times and so he popped the can open, he took a sip. And another. He gagged; one of the larger aloe bits had gone down the wrong pipe. His eyes spun wildly, hands scratching his throat, emitting only a rasp. In the cold winter night, there was nary a person passing by.

He had no idea what was about to happen. However, Jack was the Chosen One, and he had a responsibility to the world. When the CEO started talking, Jack focused hard at his face, trying to get a clear shot. He raised his hands and extended them forward, palms glowing white. Suddenly, the CEO was transfixed on Jack' s hands. Inside the CEO' s mind was pure madness. He saw his wife and kids burning, in the ruins of his childhood home. He could n' t hold back his tears. One by one, he saw everyone he ever loved melt away. His father. His mother. He saw his friends, gathered around an open casket. Inside was his own corpse. And his friends were crying... no, not crying. *Laughing. * He fell to his knees and wept. In the real world, however, nothing was to be seen but a grown man, leader of a company, sobbing uncontrollably for no reason. Jack decided to be creative this time. He made the illusion of Mickey mouse ears appear on each and every employee' s head. They were grafted on of course, and felt just like they were really there. The CEO was in for a nice surprise when he woke up. Jack used his powers to erase the minds of the executives around him, replacing thoughts of expenses and profits with the single-minded desire to give the CEO a hug. Jack giggled, not having to stifle his laughter anymore. He levitated out th window, crossing a name off his list. Jack was the Chosen One. His powers were unstoppable. He could be whatever he wanted. Obviously, whoever was doing the choosing made a mistake. That was clear to Jack, at least. Life was a role-playing game to him.

Just 18 years later the Great War of Mars broke out. I am sure that in the future others will tell the story more eloquently than I will, but at the heart of the matter was water. A pocket of subterranean ice had been discovered in a location essentially half way between the colonies. Both wanted it. The US colony was beginning to experience a boom in numbers, and wanted to secure the site so they could expand the footprint of the colony. The European colony needed it as the ice sheet near their current location was thinner than the probes said it was. As talks between the European and US representatives continued, a European colonist blew the airlock on a US colony building. It was a school. Tools meant for scientific discovery were converted into weapons. The battles were small, but lives were still lost. Then one day, after 8 months of attacks and meetings, a man named Roman Abrams made a discovery. The Earth was dark. Even with the fighting it seems strange that nobody noticed sooner.

I have this idea that the other me probably knew what was going on. I do n' t care, really, but sometimes, on dark nights, sitting alone at my desk basking in the light of my monitor, the thought crosses my mind. Weird, honestly. We were in the same preschool, elementary school, middle school and high school, but we never met until we were teenagers. I figure they were trying to seperate us in classes to observe us. My whole life was a lie. Really, I do n' t care that much. Sometimes I look back at the time and I feel bad about what I was like. Bratty, spoilt, smart-ass, outspoken. It was really a horrible time for me and anyone else who talked to me. But I had friends, I guess. Lost them now. I do n' t care. It was the times that I interacted with him that make me feel the worst. Tracking him down across the buildings, pestering him, following him into rooms. I do n' t like to think about how much I kicked and punched and smashed his face in. Why? A sense of entitlement, I guess. The kid was easy to beat up. And I had no idea he was me. The \" experiment \" was successful, I guess. They made two different people from the same person. And when I sit at home, alone, looking out onto the street filled with people having fun, with friends, I wish I could go back and try to sort things out with him. But I ca n' t. I had no idea what was going on. I had no idea that I was a disgusting person. I never knew.",

Within, two portraits at the sides: A kitten' s flushed delight And her' s, a smiling mother' s pride - Though no such look tonight. She hit the tree line at a run - the storm above her grew - thunder beat a frenzied drum and lightning forked in two. Rye had seen the mystic fork from further in the wood. Within his trembling hands, a book had said \" this sign was good. \" If the book said good, it' d have to do. The book was all he had. He' d only failed a spell, or two when the directions had been bad. So book in hand ( he checked it twice ) he drew the ancient sign. But then, Fate rolled the ancient dice: Came Sera from behind. Blinded by the lightning' s stem she stumbled into Rye. Two bodies, now as talisman would see the spell comply. Two bolts of lightning struck, and fused the magic was now done. Two mages groaned, dazed and confused not knowing what' d begun. Fate had thought it' d played a joke On mages unprepared To thwart it' s final, authored stroke: A spell with no compare. Yet when their eyes had met, they cast A familiar incantation. The ancient spell was growing fast And with it, a revelation: Within the boy Sera' d found a son, And a student fair of skill. Rye had found a mother' s love ( a role a book can' t fill ). But all the humor here is this: if you could see Rye' s mark drawn in inexperience, his pentacle was stark, Far too stark to cast the spell. And yet, from there, at last Beneath the forking thunder' s knell They both had a spell to cast edit: fixing formatting",

The one with the sexy, sexy ladies with their bosoms all up in your face? Oh, *man*. But I digress. I suppose what you really want to know is what I learned, all the boring, detailed stuff. So you do n' t want to know how I learned how all the sexiest chicks were from the past. Fair enough. You felt that your education was boring and so you had to inflict your exhaustion on me. Quid quo pro. Tit for that. I can deal with that. Okay, so, what I learned is that they wear these really revealing dresses. Am I right? Yeah, man. But none of that conical hat shit, with the tassels. That' s the Middle Ages. The King Henry VIII had 8 wives? Am I right? Maybe not, I' m a little fuzzy on the numbers. But he had a hella lot of wives. And he killed every single one of them. Well, no, he divorced a few and he made the Catholic Church -- no, he made a Church so that he could divorced. Ha! Take that, Church. Always hated Sunday School. You might be glad to know that I watched -- oh, they all had surprisingly good teeth during the Renaissance! But yeah, so I watched The Other Boleyn Girl in my spare time. Do you see how you' ve been so inspirational to me? Be proud. So there was Mary and Anne. Mary was n' t hot enough, so King Henry VIII did n' t want her. He wanted Anne. Or was it Ann? Oh well. You ca n' t blame me for this one. They sound exactly the same. Anyhow, Anne has sex with her brother and produces an ugly deformed child. And King Henry VIII has her beheaded. The end.",

From that day forth she made it her mission to make me an artist, but try as I may I never managed to draw whomever she wanted me to draw, it always ended up as somebody else. Ms Richards stopped tutoring several months later when I lost my vision from a severe fever that almost took life. Despite the fact she gave up on me I kept up my artistic endeavour at home. I remember the day I felt slightly vain and signed my portrait, I' ll never forget that my portrait of Wonder Wonder had come to life as Benjamin Franklin.

The chief is a big fan of her work, so he' s asked me to look into other users. I do n' t think we have any solid evidence against her, most of the stories on here end that way anyways. /u/Lexilogical seems friendly to everyone, almost too friendly for a mod. There' s an angle here, something I' m missing. Nothing seems fishy about her stories, though. I do n' t think she would kill over something like this... /u/Draxagon has been pretty active lately, spitting out lots of stories. He might be too new though, these murders started a while ago. Still, I' ll keep tabs on him. /u/imchrishansen_ has caught my attention lately, could be our perp. That recent story about plagiarism seemed to come straight out of a psychotic mind. But it' s Chris Hansen, who fights crimes, not commits them... I call up the chief and tell him that I' m going to follow one last lead. This guy has been trying to distract us all along, I need to see what he' s up to. /u/Fractal_Death, you' ve got some explaining to do.

Well, I do n' t agree with it. What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it gets at hardly as trivial as suggested. Speaking as a frequent reader, however, that may not be the case for the short shorts that usually get written here. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it' s only to be expected, and fitting much substance into that length is *hard*; but if I were to judge top responses on pure literary quality, I' d only very rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. In lieu of that, in practice I get interested by ideas: the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and whatever additional elements responders add to create a fresh feeling setting. I want to think about the worlds they created more than I care about the actual events they' re recounting. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction to me, but in this format I find it much more significant. So that' s one desire: to feel entranced, if only a little, by a world. If you add wish fulfillment on top, so much the better... surely near everyone reading the constant superpower prompts imagines a little the protagonist as thenselves? Though the current state of affairs is not the only possible one. If the mods managed to focus people on reality fiction a little and thereby set the bar a little higher, it might be interesting to see how writers adapt.",

I growled and stomped out of my apartment, still dressed in messy pajamas. I pounded on his door. As soon as it opened, I shouted, \" Turn that thing down! \" My neighbor looked at me as if I had not even spoken a word. \" Dude, you look like shit. What did you do yesterday? \" \" Just turn that shit down! \" I shouted one last time before stomping back to my room. What did I do yesterday, before the time loop?

Sliding my hand around the handle of my pistol, I waited, trying to figure out who was going to attempt the assassination. The grey streets outside the hotel Lavino were completely empty. Flicking a pocket watch out, I checked the time -none of this made sense, the assassination attempt would happen in exactly twenty seconds. My eyes shot up to the vehicle. *The security! * Pushing hard against the concrete, the cab loomed with each footfall. *15 seconds. * The left side of my coat came undone and in a fluid motion my pistol was out. *12 seconds. * Down the barrel of my gun, I sighted the first head to pop. The shot clipped through the air, bullet zipping from the edge of my silencer. *10 seconds. * Yelling, the Fuhrer ducked. I had missed the first security guard. I dodge rolled, taking aim again. \" Get down, Hitler! \" *7 seconds. * Muffled words in german came from inside the cab. A security guard popped his head up, I clicked to fire. My clip was jammed. An explosion rocked me back, head hitting the curb and sending stars bursting across my vision. *3 seconds. * Gurgling, I touched my neck where the metal had sliced through. This was n' t meant to happen? *1 second. * Frowning, the security guard looked down on me with his gun aimed. \" Mörder, \" he said, the word was filled with such scorn it almost rocked me as hard as the bullet. I felt my eyes dipping, and then the resounding click of metal.",

The defending champions India are playing against first timer Germans in this epic battle of world dominance. Germany' s impossible path to finals has been a truly exciting journey. The team which was not even qualified for world cup got last minute invitation, due to sudden withdrawal of Afghanistan. and Germany with its imported players from India set out to prove themselves under the captaincy of Asif Khan. They had bested Bangladesh, Scotland, New Zeeland and England to reach qualifiers. They had trashed Pakistan to get to semi-finals, and won by just 2 runs against Shri Lanka to get to the finals. And here they are just six runs way from victory with one ball remaining and eight wickets down. They are facing mighty Indians. This is unbelievable moment for fans all over the world. Pakistan had found themselves at similar situation all those world cups ago, and WON. Now the question remains, can they do it? can Germans hit the finals boundary for maximum runs and win the world cup. Indian medium pacer, Bhuwaneshwar kumar taking his run up. All the mighty batsman have bowed before kumar before. odds are highly stacked against German batsman Shafraz Samsudeen. Shafraz the only real german in the team has no previous experience of batting internationally. The presure is ginormous. Kumar bowls full toss, Shafraz swings the bat blindly and.... Well you see, *world cup* may mean different thing for different people. since I had no interest in football ( some guys call it saucer? ) I thought I would write on cricket World cup. P. S.: The player names are all real.",

They had orchestrated the largest and most horrific crime in recent memory. It seemed only fitting that Marc would get the money. His father - Samuel and mother - Jane had dinned with Presidents and Royalty. They were as indispensable members of high society. They could be relied upon to provide full coverage of waking periods, at a price of course, to the key heads of state for the wealthiest nations on earth. This ensured that the key elected government officials could work relentlessly around the clock without rest. Marc and Jane Rebus were incredibly rich. And now they were in prison. Their eldest son looking after 15 siblings. It seemed fair that he would inherit except for the fact that having spent his life under sedation, he had the appearance of fully grown man but all the capacity of a newborn child.

It was, for a little while, if nothing else. The computer gave me access to an internet of thought, a web of ideas that made perfect sense, where people were civil and appreciative. It was unlike anything I had ever thought possible. As I clicked a link that promised the solution to world peace, the screen went black. So even heaven is not without its problems. I walked back to the judge, a long trek through barren cloudscape. As soon as I appeared to him, he motioned me toward a hallway assembled from rainbows. A banner above the hall read \"Tech Support \". It was an Earthly feeling, I chuckled. A blast from the past. The hallway was not long. It was more like medium length. It must be empty because they' re so quick. Makes sense that heaven perfected tech support, I remember thinking. At the end of the multi-hued path, there was a warm brick foyer. I stepped in, and a red door appeared behind me, sealing me in. **WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? ** Well, I was on the computer and the screen went black, I explained. **PLEASE HOLD. ** There was an indistinct music that filled the room, and wormed into my ears. A lilting, ethereal tone, constantly pulling away. I hope one day I escape this room. It has been eighty years. And the music has still not approached me. It remains an ambrosia I can not digest. I laid the computer on the bricks at year ten. By year thirty I had smashed it to pieces. By year fifty, I had eaten all the pieces. It is gone, and I am still here. This must be hell.",

It all began innocently enough, with a phone call in the dead of night. An old friend, Jake, had reached out, desperate and scared, seeking refuge from an elusive group of pursuers. Against my better judgment, sympathy compelled me to help him, opening the door to a nightmare I never anticipated. Jake had unwittingly gotten tangled up with a powerful criminal organization, and now they were after him, mercilessly hunting him down. To protect him, I had to uncover their secrets, gathering evidence that could expose their nefarious operations. For days, I delved deeper into the underground world, following a precarious trail of connections and contacts. Yet, every step drew me closer to danger. Suspicion grew like a storm cloud over my head as the tendrils of the syndicate's influence snaked around my life. My home was ransacked, threats were whispered through anonymous calls, and shadowy figures lingered at every turn. Paranoia seeped into my bones, but I pressed on, driven by a stubborn determination to expose the truth. Finally, the breakthrough came when I discovered a hidden meeting place, a dilapidated warehouse concealed in the heart of the city. Armed with my findings, I naively believed that justice would prevail. Little did I know, they were always one step ahead. As I stepped into the warehouse, I realized it was a trap. Overwhelmed by a swarm of ruthless enforcers, I fought with all my might, but their strength was insurmountable. I was outnumbered, outmatched, and outgunned. In the chaos, a gunshot rang out, piercing the air, and pain seared through my body. The world blurred, spinning out of control as gravity took hold. Memories flashed before my eyes, unfulfilled dreams and cherished moments intertwined with regret. Regret for the choices I made, the risks I took, and the trust I misplaced.",

Little did anyone know that its impact would extend far beyond entertainment. Suddenly, hordes of aliens from distant galaxies descended upon Earth, not with hostile intentions or a desire to forge alliances, but rather to beg for mercy. They pleaded for humanity to cease sending their scouts, known as \"Players,\" who had unknowingly been wreaking havoc upon these unsuspecting civilizations. The aliens were defenseless against the advanced weaponry and technology possessed by the Players, who regarded their actions as mere gameplay. Distraught, the aliens communicated their distress through a global broadcast, desperate to make humanity understand the devastation they had caused. The once-thriving civilizations were reduced to rubble, their cultures erased. Witnessing the intergalactic plea, humanity was struck by a collective wave of guilt, realizing the unimaginable consequences of their actions. Governments and scientists scrambled to find a solution, calling for a worldwide ceasefire in the virtual universe. No Man's Sky was updated overnight, restricting the activities of Players within specific zones to prevent further destruction. Diplomatic channels were opened, as efforts to rebuild trust between Earth and the aggrieved alien civilizations were set in motion. Cautiously, humanity started to make amends, pledging resources and expertise to aid in the restoration process. The fifth year after the release of No Man's Sky marked a turning point, where mankind learned a profound lesson about the impact of their actions, and vowed to be more considerate custodians of both virtual and real worlds alike.",

The once-peaceful creatures of Fluffington became Cuddles' devoted followers, willingly obeying its every command. The bunny's rise to power was relentless and unstoppable.With an army of woodland creatures at its disposal, Cuddles turned its attention to neighboring kingdoms.

But something just felt off. I didn't quite fit in with my family, neither physically nor in terms of my interests and personality. I decided it was time to put these doubts to rest once and for all. With a determined resolve, I gathered samples from myself, my parents, and my siblings. We all agreed to get our DNA tested, hoping it would provide some clarity. I carefully packaged the samples and sent them off to a renowned lab that specialized in genetic testing. Days turned into weeks, and the anticipation was eating away at me. Finally, a letter arrived from the lab. My heart raced as I tore it open, eager to finally uncover the truth. But as I read the contents, confusion washed over me. The lab explained that they were not equipped to test non-human DNA. Non-human DNA? What did that even mean?I was baffled. What could possibly be considered \"non-human\" in our family's DNA? Questions multiplied in my mind like wildfire. My parents noticed my distress and sat me down for a serious conversation. They explained that the lab's response must have been a mistake. There was no reason to suspect anything unusual about our family.However, their words only fueled my curiosity further. If everything was as normal as they claimed, why couldn't we simply redo the test? I insisted that we find a different lab, one capable of handling all kinds of DNA. My parents reluctantly agreed, sensing how important this was to me.We searched for another lab and eventually found one that specialized in comprehensive genetic testing. Again, we collected our samples and sent them off, hoping for a conclusive answer this time. The waiting period was excruciating, but I refused to let doubt consume me. I needed to know the truth.Finally, a second letter arrived, and I apprehensively opened it.",

The Socialists, acting as the Clerics, sought to heal the wounds of societal inequality with their policies of redistribution and compassion. Meanwhile, the Libertarians functioned as the Rogues, advocating for personal freedom and limited government intervention. The Greens emerged as the embodiment of nature itself, embodying the Druid class, as they strived to protect the environment and promote sustainability. The Nationalists, akin to the Barbarians, fiercely defended the kingdom's borders and championed the values of their culture. The technologically adept Technocrats, much like the Wizards, wielded the power of innovation and progress, seeking to shape policies through empirical evidence and expertise. The Moderates, acting as the versatile Rangers, maneuvered between various factions, bridging gaps and seeking compromise. Lastly, the Anarchists, true to their chaotic nature, acted as the Sorcerers, wielding unpredictable power and yearning to dismantle systems for a free and equal society.

The Devil's eyes glinted with an unsettling amusement as he explained, \"Your soul is tarnished, but not irredeemable. I prefer souls steeped in darkness, souls that willingly embrace wickedness. Yours, however, still clings to the light.\" A flicker of hope ignited within me. Was redemption possible even in the clutches of the Devil? Sensing my thoughts, the Devil smirked. \"But make no mistake,\" he warned, \"there is a price for redemption.\" Intrigued, I implored him to reveal the cost. He leaned closer, his voice a whisper in the wind. \"You must prove your worth. Perform acts of kindness, charity, and compassion. Only then will your soul be worthy of my interest.\" With those words, the Devil vanished into the shadows, leaving me alone with my thoughts.

I found myself back in the mundane world, a single dad living in a modest apartment in New York City. Gone were the enchanted weapons and spellbooks; now, my days were consumed by diaper changes and supermarket runs. My children, Sophie and Max, were my new companions on this journey.

But I had mastered the art of persuasion, honing my skills to the point where even the most suspicious homeowners granted me admittance without a second thought. And so, I thrived, a vampire among mortals, protecting them while relying on their unwitting cooperation.",

One day, while daydreaming in class, he noticed something peculiar. The class jock, Brian, suddenly started repeating the same sentence over and over again. Josh's heart raced as he realized that somehow, he had influenced Brian's thoughts. Confused yet intrigued, he decided to experiment with his newfound power. During lunch break, he focused on the group of popular girls, willing them to invite him to sit with them. To his amazement, they eagerly waved him over, completely under his influence. With each successful attempt, Josh's confidence grew. He began using his power to change classmates' opinions on various matters, subtly molding his peers' ideas to align with his own. Josh went from being a nobody to a figure of authority, his words carrying weight and influence. However, as time passed, a nagging guilt crept in. He realized that his actions were an invasion of privacy and a violation of free will. Troubled, Josh decided to stop using his power and seek a way to renounce it. He confided in his science teacher, Ms. Thomas, who recommended researching the origins and potential repercussions of his ability. Josh delved into ancient texts, seeking guidance from forgotten wisdom. His quest led him to a reclusive mentor who taught him to channel his power for good. Armed with new knowledge and a redefined purpose, Josh returned to school with a mission: to empower, inspire, and uplift his fellow students, rather than manipulate them. Gradually, the popularity he once sought paled in comparison to the genuine connections he formed. Josh's ability, once a curse, transformed into a gift he used to foster empathy, understanding, and unity among his classmates.",

The once bustling streets were now lined with Wal-Mart supercenters, towering over the cityscape like monolithic structures of consumerism.Inside these mammoth stores, citizens could find everything they needed, from basic necessities to luxury items. However, any form of dissent against Wal-Mart's rule was strictly prohibited. Surveillance cameras monitored every corner, ensuring compliance and reporting any signs of disobedience.The company's executives, known as the \"Corporate Elders,\" wielded absolute power, making laws and regulations without any opposition. Their lavish lifestyles starkly contrasted with those of the impoverished masses, trapped in a relentless cycle of consumerism and debt.Citizens were forced to work grueling hours in Wal-Mart factories, producing goods sold exclusively under the company's brand. Their meager wages barely covered the cost of living, fostering a sense of dependency on the very entity that oppressed them.However, a small resistance movement began to emerge in secret. A group of rebels, known as the \"Smiley Faces,\" organized clandestine meetings, strategizing ways to defy Wal-Mart's reign. Their leader, a fearless woman named Maya, inspired hope in the hearts of the oppressed.Maya understood the power of information. With the help of tech-savvy allies, she hacked into Wal-Mart's central database, revealing the corporation's corrupt practices to the world.

From the elegant Kantian gates of the Xiorians to the intricate Salec skip drives employed by the Myr'kesh, every species wielded their preferred mode of interstellar transportation.Among this illustrious array of FTL technologies, one solution stood out, and not for the reasons humanity might have hoped. Earth's ingenious method was regarded as \"Unorthodox,\" \"Unsafe,\" and even \"Damn Stupid\" by the galactic community. While the Kantian gates allowed Xiorians to bend spacetime effortlessly, and the Maltiun wave-riders allowed the Hradok to surf the fabric of reality, humanity opted for an approach that defied conventional wisdom. They constructed what others called a \"Warping Engine,\" a contraption that generated unpredictable rifts in spacetime to propel their ships across vast distances.The first time humanity tested their unorthodox FTL travel, they were greeted with disbelief and amusement. The galactic council watched with raised eyebrows as the human vessel, christened the Pioneer, sputtered into the unknown, its crew exuding a mix of excitement and apprehension.To their surprise, the Pioneer emerged from the other side of the rift unharmed, albeit covered in peculiar energy readings. The galactic community fell into a stunned silence as they witnessed the success of humanity's folly.Curiosity piqued, species from across the galaxy began to study the Warp Engine's workings, skeptical yet intrigued by its unconventional approach. Parties of scientists and engineers flocked to Earth, eager to understand the enigma behind this so-called \"Unsafe\" and \"Damn Stupid\" technology.Over time, humanity's Warp Engine underwent refinements and improvements, reducing the energy emissions and enhancing stability.",

Meanwhile, Alex sat on a bench nearby, watching the joyful chaos of the park unfold before him. He had never been a fan of roller coasters, preferring the calmness of the carousel instead. As he observed children laughing and families creating beautiful memories, he couldn't help but smile. Inside the control room, the park operator, Mr. Johnson, monitored the rides through a bank of screens. He diligently ensured that everything was running smoothly, making adjustments here and there for the optimal experience. His years of experience had made him an expert in amusement park operations, and he took great pride in his work. Elsewhere in the park, Lily held tightly onto her mother's hand as they walked through a maze of colorful stalls. The enticing scent of cotton candy filled the air, and Lily's eyes widened with wonder. She tugged impatiently at her mother's hand, eager to try a game and win a stuffed animal.

Determined to make amends before it was too late, he devised a plan to set things right. The first step was to seek forgiveness from his estranged daughter, Sarah, whom he had abandoned years ago. With trembling hands, he dialed her number and apologized for his absence, promising to make it right. Sarah's voice softened and she tearfully accepted his apology, giving him hope that redemption was possible. Next, Henry visited the local homeless shelter, where he had once turned a blind eye to those in need. He volunteered tirelessly, serving meals and offering companionship to the lonely. Each smile he received from the grateful faces warmed his troubled soul. Wanting to rectify his past financial misdeeds, Henry donated a significant portion of his savings to charities and organizations that supported causes he had once neglected. The weight of guilt began to lift with each act of kindness, sparking a renewed sense of purpose within him. Henry then turned his attention to his neglected friendships, reaching out to old acquaintances and initiating heartfelt conversations.

Slowly but surely, his old companions welcomed him back into their lives, their forgiveness healing his wounded spirit.

He felt compelled to advocate for the issues he had once ignored, speaking out against injustice and using his voice to amplify the voices of the marginalized. With fervor, he attended rallies, wrote letters to politicians, and vowed to be a force for change.

The evidence presented against Mark seemed circumstantial, and doubts began to creep into John's mind. He couldn't ignore the nagging feeling that Mark was falsely accused of his own heinous crimes. Unbeknownst to everyone else, John had an uncanny ability to understand the psychology of killers. He had spent years studying his own actions, and now he used that knowledge to carefully analyze the behavior of the alleged victims. To his horror, he realized that the real murderer was still at large. This revelation shook John to his core. He had killed countless innocent people, thinking he was cleansing the world. But now, he had a chance to atone for his sins in a way he never anticipated. John started discreetly investigating the crimes, digging into the victim profiles and the evidence presented in court. As he delved deeper, he discovered chilling similarities between his own acts and the newly found details. He also uncovered crucial clues that pointed to another person's involvement. With mounting evidence, John approached Mark's defense attorney, revealing his true identity and offering his assistance.

Mountains rose from the earth, carving out valleys and plains across vast continents. Rivers flowed from glacial peaks, cutting path ways across the land. Oceans swelled with mysterious depths, separated the lands with azure blue. As the terrain took shape, so too did the multitude of life that would inhabit it. Strange beasts walked the land, swam the seas and took wing in the skies. Intelligent races developed diverse cultures, some seeking to understand magic, others exploring science. They built towering cities, mighty fortresses and humble villages tucked within forests and hills. Powers awoke within some, granting abilities beyond those of other mortals. Some commanded the elements, others could warp the fabric of reality itself. But even the most gifted were still at the mercy of darker forces stirring in shadowed corners of the world. Ancient evils predating even the eldest races began to stir from their slumber, hungering to plunge the land into chaos once more.Heroes arose to stand against the tides of war and magic that threatened to engulf the world. Through their trials and sacrifices, a fragile peace was maintained throughout generations to come. Thus was born a genre-defining world, shaped by my imagination to be a vast stage where legends could be forged and destiny could be shaped by those bold enough to seize it. The world was complete. Now, its story could truly begin.",

Word spread quickly through the underground pathways. Spiders spun webs floating with questions instead of prey. Bees buzzed in a panic, realizing the complex world they were now part of. A gnat hovered in confusion, wondering what its new purpose could be. Grasshoppers leapt and chirped, debating what this development could mean for their kind. Crickets fell silent, processing this massive change to their tiny lives. Butterflies fluttered frantically, contemplating the ethics of being both predator and prey. Flies swarmed in disarray, attempting to comprehend their place in the wider world. Every bug realized this would change the natural order forever.

Heartbroken, John fell to his knees and let out an agonizing scream as his happy ending was destroyed in an unthinkable moment.",

It was clear they were in the midst of a vivid dream. At first their movements were calm yet animated, as if playing out a pleasant fantasy. But then their breathing became labored and expressions tightened into ones of distress. Whatever dreamworld they now inhabited seemed to be transforming into a nightmare. Through ragged breaths they began to mutter incoherent words and phrases. Leaning in closer, I was able to make out references to chasing unseen forces and fleeing from unknown dangers. Their restless motions grew more frantic and frenzied, accompanied now by sounds of fear and panic. Unsure of what else to do, I gently shook their shoulder to rouse them from the troubled vision. With a fright, their eyes flew open and unseeing stared up at me for a long moment as memory and reality sorted themselves out. Gradually their rapid pulsations slowed and tense form relaxed into quiet relief. Though the dream was now over, its disturbing impressions still lingered strongly in both our minds long after.

She was now alone in the world, with only memories of her family left. Death watched from the shadows as she grieved. He wanted to comfort her but did not know how.

Its grin showed too many teeth, stretched too wide across its nightmare face. He froze, breath catching in his throat. The creature took a slow step towards him, enjoying his terror. All he could do was stand paralyzed as it circled around him. Its mouth hung open, dripping with saliva as it studied him. Every part of him screamed to run but his legs refused to obey. As it came closer, he caught a whiff of its foul breath. Its grin widened even further like it could smell his fear. With a herculean effort, he forced himself to turn and flee blindly into the trees. Branches clawed at his face and clothes as he crashed through the undergrowth. The sounds of pursuit grew ever closer - it was toying with him, savoring the chase. His foot caught a root and he slammed into the dirt, pain shooting through his ankle. Lying prone, he rolled over to see it looming over him, drool dripping from Its gaping jaws. This was the end. With a roar, It lunged for the kill. At the last moment, his hand closed around a fallen branch. With a cry he swung, feeling the stick connect solidly. The creature reeled back with an unearthly howl. He scrambled up and limped as fast as he could on his injured ankle. Glancing back, he saw It retreating into the shadows, yellow eyes staring after him.

For centuries, magic was wielded through the four classical elements of earth, air, fire and water drawn from the natural world. But one young mage named Aria claimed to have discovered a new form of magic beyond the old ways. She began her demonstration and called upon strands of pure mystic energy, manipulating the invisible forces through intricate gestures and chants. Everyone watched in awe as colors shifted in the air and floating orbs of light appeared. Aria showed she had mastery over this unknown system, twisting the energies into amazing shapes and patterns. But some of the older magicians were skeptical, insisting one could only draw power from the stable sources that had always existed. On the final day of trials, Aria sought to change their minds by attempting her most challenging feat yet. She would try to summon a magical construct and breathe life into it through her new form of magic alone. After lengthy preparations, a shimmering creature took form, bringing astonished gasps from all who witnessed its impossible existence.Yet just when it seemed Aria had triumphed, something went wrong with her spell. The magical forces spiraled out of her control and the glowing being twisted into a malevolent form. It turned on the audience with a roar as an unnatural storm erupted in the hall. Aria struggled desperately to end her spell but it was too late to stop the chaos. The Magisterium was plunged into crisis as they faced this new type of magic, both its promise and its peril.

The cool night air raised goosebumps on my flesh. I stepped lightly through the forest, searching for any trace of civilization. Broken branches and boot prints in the mud offered a direction to follow. Between the trees, a flickering light came into view. I crept closer and realized it was a campfire outside a small cabin. An old man sat beside it, smoking a pipe. Staying downwind, I dared move no closer. As the moon set, the pull came again to change once more. My organs twisted within me as fur and claw regrew. On four paws once more, I turned and vanished into the protecting shadows of the woods. The next month, perhaps, I would try contacting the man if he was still there.

Her clothes fell loose around her as she dropped to all fours, shrinking smaller and smaller. She tried to call out for help but instead a meow escaped her lips.Trapped in her new kitten body, Sara pawed at the fence, unable to climb over in her new tiny form.

The vet examined Sara closely, finding no signs of injury from the kitten bite besides two small holes in her tiny paw pad. He'd never seen anything like this before and had no answers for how to change her back. For now, Sara was stuck as a kitten.

Janice spent weeks carefully planning her escape, gathering supplies and mapping out where she would go so as not to be tracked.The night before she planned to leave, Janice had second thoughts about leaving her old life behind. But the life she was living didn't feel worth living either. With sadness in her heart, she said goodbye to her home one last time.At midnight, Janice set her plan in motion. She left clues around her small apartment and then snuck out the back quietly into the night. After miles of walking, she finally arrived at her destination - an isolated cabin deep in the wilderness. Now came the difficult part - staying hidden for the rest of her days while evading any attempts to find her. Janice knew it wasn't an ideal solution, but it was better than the alternative of endless suffering. Here, in the silence of the forest, she hoped to finally find peace.",

So many brave souls have walked past, meeting their end further down the ruins. My bones have borne witness to the rise and fall of civilizations. When first I fell, this land was green and lush. Now only dry earth and ashes remain.Countless warriors have tried to retrieve the souls I once held, but none prevailed. Through shifting mists and altering lands, I remained. Fire came and went, calamities struck, yet my skeleton held steadfast. Even dragons alighted among these old stones that saw my end. In the distance, smoke sometimes rises from a far settlement. Most who pass spare me no glance, focused on their own fated struggles. Yet a rare few linger in silent mourning, as if glimpsing something more in my hollow sockets. My purpose is done, but still these ruins contain untold secrets for those brave enough to seek them. And so I lay, witness to histories no book could tell, awaiting the future this crumbled hall may yet behold.",

When my father announced his intention to name me as his heir at my 18th birthday celebration, I could no longer stay silent. I told him clearly that I did not want the duties or pressures that came with being the duke. My father was furious, refusing to believe I would reject this opportunity.Arguments grew heated as he tried to change my mind, listing all the privileges and honor that would come with the title. I held firm in my refusal, insisting I wanted a life of adventure not tied down by obligations to the duchy and our people. My defiant stance caused a rift in our relationship. In the following months, my father barely spoke to me, hoping my resolve would weaken under his cold treatment. But I had made up my mind and nothing would sway me from my choice. Without an heir, my father's advisers pressed him to name my younger brother as the new heir instead. Reluctantly, my father agreed but remained bitterly disappointed in me. I packed my bags, said goodbye to my family, and left our estate to seek my fortune elsewhere. Free from the shackles of responsibility, I have spent the past year traveling the world on daring expeditions.For the first time in my life, I am answerable to no one and able to live fully on my own terms. Although my relationship with my father remains strained, I do not regret my choice to refuse the duties of an heir for the adventures of an independent man.",

I'd been given supernatural powers of attraction and seduction.On Earth once more, I set about my new role. It was surprisingly easy - a flash of smile here, a caress there. Humans fell before me with little resistance. Still, manipulating people left a rotten feeling inside. Was this really something I wanted to do for eternity?

To my shock, he was pleased with my success. \"You've outperformed my previous sin,\" he boasted.  But I had other plans now.

I stood my ground, insisting my work was done. With a roar, Lucifer grabbed me by the throat.Through sheer force of will, I broke his grip. We faced off, his power against my growing resolve.

Strange carvings and hieroglyphs covered every surface, but I couldn't decipher their meaning. As I peered into one shadowy alcove, I stepped on a hidden pressure plate. A rumbling shook the temple as long-dormant traps sprang to life. Dart launchers fired and spears shot from the walls.

Within hours, several more people had turned.The military was deployed, but coordinating a response proved difficult due to the zombies' random movements. They shambled down streets, occasionally grabbing at anyone they happened to encounter.However, it quickly became apparent that the zombies possessed no real coordination or higher brain function. They wandered aimlessly and could barely manage to eat the occasional victim.After only a day, the zombies had mostly just laid down in the middle of roads or fields, losing interest once their immediate hunger was satisfied. With no real packs or communicated threats, they posed little danger.The remaining living inhabitants of the town were easily able to avoid the shambling corpses or fight them off one by one when needed. By nightfall, most zombies had simply collapsed motionless. An autopsy of one zombie revealed it had died of starvation, as it was unable to effectively hunt or forage on its own. Within 25 hours, the last zombie had expired, marking the end of the outbreak.The CDC declared the zombie threat neutralized. It seemed that without human coordination or intelligence, individual zombies were effectively harmless on their own.The town began to rebuild, and the federal government launched studies to better understand how to contain future outbreaks, which they hoped would also prove as ineffectual as the first.Many were left to wonder what might have happened if the zombies had displayed even basic survival skills or pack instincts, but for now, the residents could rest easy knowing the threat had passed.",

Their demands were cruel and humanity had no choice but to comply if they wanted to survive. Leaders from all nations met to discuss their final options. They knew full surrender meant eventual enslavement and extermination. After long deliberations a risky plan began to take shape. Advanced weapons would be smuggled onto the main alien vessel and detonated, even if it cost every remaining human life. Volunteers were selected for the suicide mission. They trained relentlessly to infiltrate the massive ship without detection. When the day came, they flew a small shuttle directly into the ship's hangar as a scheduled delivery. Cameras saw only what the aliens expected. Under cover of darkness the saboteurs split up and raced through the ship planting explosives at key structural points. An alarm sounded, their presence had been found. A chase ensued through the high-tech metallic corridors as alien security closed in. Several volunteers were killed in firefights but others continued on, a few reaching their final targets. With seconds to spare the remaining men initiated detonation sequences on their bombs. A huge blast ripped through the vessel, ripping it apart from within. Escape pods launched but the ship was doomed. Back on Earth, satellites observed the massive explosion rip the alien ship to pieces. It began tumbling out of orbit, a flaming wreck. A cheer went up among the surviving humans, their last desperate attack had succeeded beyond hope. But there was no time to celebrate, three more enemy ships remained. Missile batteries opened fire on the closest one in a futile attempt to aid humanity's final act of defiance. At least they would not surrender without one last battle.",

But it turned out that aliens were not lurking among distant solar systems, but rather in our own backyard, hidden from view in the deepest reaches of Earth's oceans. On a routine dive to survey undersea geothermal vents, researchers were stunned to encounter strange structures crafted from chemicals and rocks, with complex textures that seemed deliberately designed. Video footage and samples were analyzed back on land, and it became clear these were no natural formations, but artifacts of an unknown intelligence living far below the waves.Attempts were made to communicate via video feeds and carefully positioned signals, with increasing success over months of slow interaction. It emerged these beings, dubbed the \"abyssopians,\" lacked voices but had developed an electrical communication system, sending and receiving waves through their surroundings. While bizarre anatomically, with no eyes or limbs, the abyssopians exhibited keen problem solving abilities and an advanced ecological understanding of the vent ecosystems they called home. They harvested chemicals from the vents for fuels and building materials, and cultivated thermal-loving microbes on \"farms\" to sustain their energy needs.World governments came together to fund a joint deep-sea research station, with advanced submersibles and Internet 2-style connectivity, to foster deeper understanding between humans and the unexpected neighbor we had discovered at the bottom of the sea. While barriers of biology and environment initially made true interaction challenging, open exchange of knowledge was transforming views of what life might emerge in isolation on our shared planet.",

Everyone fell silent as it tumbled end over end, gathering speed toward the hard floor below. A gasp rose up from all of existence as it struck with a cacophonous crack. Chaos erupted where once was order, as stars collided and planets flew apart. Among the wreckage intelligence emerged, trying to make sense of this new reality. Over time, pockets of life formed, working together or against one another for survival. Eons passed as civilizations rose and fell, forever changed by the shattering of perfect design. Eventually a question echoed across the sprawling ruins: how had this all begun, and could it happen again?",

We convened in the corner, whispering our plan to escape this bureaucratic nightmare. Our first step was to obtain the proper forms from Records Department 3B. After two days in line, I secured the documents and rushed back to share the news. However, the forms required a date stamp from Authorizations before they could be processed. More days wasted inching forward, but we persisted with our plan. At last, the forms received their stamp and we filed into Applications. A cheerful clerk greeted us, but said we missed a signature on page thirty-seven. She helpfully provided the routing number for the Signatures office. There, a surly clerk begrudgingly added his mark after much complaining. Papers finally complete, we headed to Reviewal. A bored supervisor informed us all objects must first pass Inspection. Inspection's line was, of course, the longest yet. Tempers flared as souls jockeyed for position. Just as chaos seemed inevitable, the inspector waved us through with scarcely a glance at our forms. With freedom in sight, we ran to the exit, only to find it locked tight behind thick bars. Our apparent escape had only landed us in a darker cell of bureaucratic hell.",

It arrived in a small village and scanned for any records of future resistance leaders. Finding nothing of use, it moved on to the next place. A farming couple saw the Terminator emerge from the tree line and were immediately afraid of the strange metal man. They fled in terror to the local lord's castle. The lord summoned his men and rode out to confront the intruder. Spears and swords were no match for the Terminator's endoskeleton. It had come for information, not violence, but was forced to disable the men to continue its search. Word of the metal demon spread across the countryside. Peasants locked themselves inside as night fell, praying for salvation. The Terminator accessed abandoned homes and churches, still finding no records to link to John Connor. Analysis revealed its chances of success were diminishing over time in this era. If it could not complete its primary objective, a new strategy was needed.The Terminator realized it must alter the future by eliminating potential ancestors of its target. It tracked bloodlines back through centuries and identified distant relatives living in these medieval lands. With a new purpose, it began systematically reaching each small community. Those related to Connor through families long since branches would not survive to pass on their bloodline. Its movements were faster and stealthier now in the darkness. Whole villages were silenced under cover of night, their livestock and valuables left untouched. Survivors fled in horror, not comprehending the technological terror stalking them.

I looked around, confused, and saw that my roommate was still watching TV, but there was no sound coming from it.I tried to shake off the feeling and went about my day, but it quickly became apparent that something was wrong. The streets were eerily quiet, and people were walking around with confused looks on their faces.As the days went by, scientists confirmed our worst fears: sound had ceased to exist. It wasn't just music or speech, but all sound, including the hum of the refrigerator and the chirping of birds. The world was suddenly, and inexplicably, silent.In the immediate aftermath, people were in a state of shock. They wandered the streets, unsure of what to do or how to communicate. Some tried to use sign language, but it was slow and awkward. Others wrote notes to each other, but it was cumbersome and inefficient.As the days turned into weeks, society began to adapt. Businesses started using flashing lights or vibrations to communicate with customers. People learned to read lips and use hand gestures to communicate with each other.But the silence was oppressive. It weighed heavy on our minds and made us feel isolated and alone. The lack of sound made it difficult to sleep, and many people suffered from insomnia and anxiety.10 years have passed since the silence descended, and society has transformed in ways we never could have imagined. The world is a different place now, one where sound is just a distant memory.People have learned to live in this new reality, but it's not without its challenges. There are no more concerts, no more laughter, no more singing. The beauty of music is now just a memory, a distant recollection of a time when sound filled our lives.",

But one day, her fascination turned to obsession, and she delved too deep into the darkness.As she wandered through the crumbling streets of the town's old district, Emily stumbled upon a mysterious artifact - a book bound in human skin, adorned with strange symbols that seemed to shift and writhe like living things. She knew she had to have it, no matter the cost. But as soon as she touched the book, she felt a chill run down her spine, as if something malevolent had taken notice of her.In the following days, strange things began to happen. People would disappear, only to turn up dead, their bodies bearing the same twisted symbols that adorned the book. Emily's friends and family grew concerned, but she refused to listen, convinced that she had finally found the elusive proof of the supernatural she had always sought.One night, as she delved deeper into the book's dark magic, Emily felt a presence watching her. She turned to see a figure standing in the shadows, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. The figure moved closer, its presence filling the room with an unspeakable evil. Suddenly, the lights flickered, and the figure vanished, leaving Emily alone and shaken.The next day, Emily's parents came home to find their daughter missing.",

The story portrayed me as a monster, someone who reveled in the suffering of others.I felt a cold sweat trickling down my spine as I read on. How could anyone think that I was capable of such horrors? I knew that I had to do something, but I didn't know what. I couldn't just sit there and let people think that I was a monster.I decided to try and find the person who had written the story. Maybe they would listen to reason and take it down. I scrolled through the author's profile, trying to find any information that could lead me to them. But it was all in vain. There was no way to contact them, no way to make them understand.I felt a sense of hopelessness wash over me. How could I ever escape this horrifying portrayal of myself? I knew that I wasn't a monster, but how could I prove it to the world? I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare that I couldn't wake up from.I decided to try and forget about it, to pretend that it never happened. But how could I forget about something that had shaken me to my very core? I knew that I would never be able to look at myself the same way again.",

The task was to write a short story set in a dystopian future where humanity had colonized other planets.I spent the next hour brainstorming ideas and outlining my story. I decided to set my story on a planet called Nova Haven, where humans had established a bleak and oppressive colony.The main character was a young woman named Maya, who had always dreamed of escaping the planet and exploring the galaxy. She worked as a technician on the colony's massive generators, which provided the only source of power for the settlement.One day, Maya discovered a hidden message in the Generator's code, which hinted at the existence of a secret spaceship hidden deep within the planet's crust.Determined to find the ship and escape Nova Haven, Maya began to secretly work on a plan. She knew it wouldn't be easy, as the colony was heavily guarded and monitored by the government.Maya spent the next few days gathering materials and resources, all while avoiding suspicion from her colleagues and superiors. She worked tirelessly, often sacrificing sleep and meals to achieve her goal.Finally, the day arrived when Maya was ready to put her plan into action. She snuck into the Generator room under the cover of night, and began to hack into the system.As she worked, the Generator began to malfunction, causing a massive blackout across the colony. Maya knew this would create a window of opportunity for her to sneak past the guards and find the hidden ship.With a racing heart, Maya made her way through the dark and deserted corridors of the colony, avoiding patrolling guards and dodging security drones.",

She was from a small country in Europe, and her native language was Greek. I had always been fascinated by her culture and language, and I decided to learn Greek as an act of love towards her.At first, it was difficult. Greek was a language that was vastly different from my native English, and it took me a while to get the hang of it. But with the help of my ear device, I was able to practice and improve quickly. Sophia was impressed with my dedication and enthusiasm, and we started spending more and more time together.As we spent more time together, I started to realize that I wasn't falling in love with Sophia's personality, but with the ear device's get-along editing feature. It was a feature that allowed me to communicate with Sophia in her own language, without any awkwardness or misunderstandings. It was like having a personal translator, always there to help me express my thoughts and feelings.I started to depend on the ear device more and more, and I found myself using it all the time. I would even use it when Sophia and I were alone, just to make sure that I was saying the right things. It became a crutch for me, and I didn't know how to communicate without it.Sophia started to notice my reliance on the ear device, and she began to feel neglected. She would try to talk to me in English, but I would always respond in Greek, using the ear device to translate. She started to feel like I was more interested in the technology than in her.One day, Sophia confronted me about my use of the ear device. She told me that she felt like I was hiding behind it, and that I wasn't making an effort to truly connect with her.",

The swords themselves looked ancient, their blades gleaming in the moonlight. I approached cautiously, my hand on the hilt of my own sword, ready to defend myself if needed.As I drew closer, I saw that the dais had a small inscription etched into its surface. It read, \"The left sword turns you into a villain that saves the world. The right sword turns you into a hero that damns the world.\" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized the weight of the choice before me.I looked at the swords, trying to see any difference between them. They looked identical to me, their blades sharp and deadly. How could I know which one to choose? I thought about the state of the world, about the wars and famines, the suffering and injustice.I knew that I had always wanted to be a hero, to make a difference and leave the world a better place than I found it.

Could I truly say that I was willing to do whatever it took to save the world, even if it meant becoming a villain?I looked at the swords again, and my heart was heavy with indecision. I knew that I had to make a choice, but I didn't know which one to make. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, trying to clear my mind and listen to my heart.Finally, I made my decision. I reached out and grasped the hilt of the left sword, feeling a surge of power run through me.",

She felt a sudden urge to break free from the constraints of the wall and embrace the unknown waters beyond.Without hesitation, Luna hopped over the barrier and onto the sandy beach, her heart racing with excitement and fear. She took a deep breath, feeling the salty air fill her lungs, and began to walk towards the water. The waves gently lapped at her feet, inviting her to come closer.As she waded into the ocean, Luna felt a sense of liberation wash over her. She was finally free from the constraints of the wall and the fear that had held her back for so long. The water was cool and refreshing, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and awe as she looked out at the vast expanse of the sea.She swam out further and further, the water getting deeper and darker, until she was completely immersed in the ocean's embrace. Luna felt a sense of peace and freedom that she had never felt before, and she knew that she would never forget this moment. She was no longer held back by her fear, and she knew that she was capable of anything.As she swam back towards the shore, Luna felt a sense of gratitude for the ocean and its power to transform her. She knew that she would never look at the sea in the same way again, and that she would always cherish the memories of this night, the night she broke free from her fear and embraced the unknown.",

Here's a story based on the writing prompt:I've been lucky to have had many kind words spoken to me over the years, but one phrase that stands out in particular was said by my grandmother.I was feeling particularly down one day, struggling with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.My grandmother, who had always been my biggest supporter, took me aside and looked me in the eye.\"You know, kiddo,\" she said, \"you're an amazing person. You're kind, smart, and talented. Don't ever forget that.\"Her words struck a chord in me and made me realize that I had been focusing too much on my shortcomings.From that day on, I made a conscious effort to shift my perspective and concentrate on my strengths.My grandmother's kind words gave me the confidence boost I needed to pursue my dreams.Years later, I found myself in a position to help others, and I made sure to pass on the same message of encouragement that my grandmother had given me.I told them that they too were amazing, and that they had so much potential.I wanted them to know that they were not alone, and that they had someone in their corner rooting for them.As I looked into their eyes, I could see the same spark of hope that my grandmother had ignited in me all those years ago.It was a powerful moment, and it reminded me of the impact that a single kind phrase can have on someone's life.My grandmother may not be with me physically anymore, but her words of encouragement will always be with me, inspiring me to pay it forward and spread positivity wherever I can.",

They had been planning this heist for months, and they were ready to make off with millions of dollars. But as they rushed inside, they quickly realized that something was off.Instead of stacks of cash, they found rows of strange, glowing objects. They looked like small, metallic spheres, and they seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy. The thieves were confused and a little scared. What were these things?One of them, a towering man named Max, cautiously approached one of the spheres and touched it. It felt warm to the touch, and seemed to vibrate with an odd power. Suddenly, Max let out a cry of pain and stumbled backward, clutching his hand.\"What the hell?\" he shouted. \"It burned me!\"The other thieves gathered around, unsure of what to do. They looked at each other nervously, wondering if they had stumbled into some kind of trap. But then, one of them noticed something strange.The spheres were beginning to glow brighter, and they seemed to be pulsing in time with each other. It was as if they were communicating with each other, or even charging up for some kind of attack.The thieves knew they had to get out of there, fast. They grabbed their bags and started to make a run for it, but it was too late. The spheres began to emit a blinding flash of light, and the thieves were caught in the beam.When the light faded, the thieves found themselves in a strange, alien world. They were standing on a barren, rocky plain, surrounded by towering, glowing plants. They had no idea how they had gotten there, or how to get back home.As they looked around, they saw strange creatures moving in the distance. They were unlike anything they had ever seen before – tall, slender beings with long, flowing limbs. They seemed to be watching the thieves, studying them with an unnerving intensity.The thieves knew they had to be careful.",

Every day, Whiskers would wake up, eat his food, and lounge around the house, longing for something exciting to happen.One day, while lounging on the windowsill, Whiskers saw a strange object outside the window. It was a robot, shiny and new, with gears and wires exposed.Whiskers was both curious and afraid, but his curiosity got the better of him. He crept closer to the robot, his tail twitching with excitement.The robot noticed Whiskers and reached out a metallic hand. \"Hello, I'm Robby,\" it said in a robotic voice.Whiskers was taken aback but decided to introduce himself. \"I'm Whiskers. What are you doing here?\"Robby explained that he was on a mission to explore the world and learn about all the creatures that lived on Earth.Whiskers was fascinated by Robby's stories and asked if he could join him on his adventures.Robby was happy to have a companion and agreed to take Whiskers along. They set off into the city, exploring streets and alleys, meeting all sorts of animals along the way.As they explored, Whiskers realized that he had never been happier. He had always been content with his mundane life, but now he was experiencing the world in a whole new way.Robby, too, was enjoying the company. He had never interacted with a creature as curious and playful as Whiskers before.Together, they encountered dogs, birds, and even a few humans. Whiskers hissed at them, but Robby reassured him that they were harmless.After a long day of exploring, Robby and Whiskers returned to Whiskers' apartment. Whiskers was exhausted but exhilarated.\"Thank you for today, Robby,\" Whiskers said. \"I never knew how boring my life was until now.\"Robby was pleased to have been able to show Whiskers the joys of adventure. \"Anytime, Whiskers.

The scenery is familiar, yet somehow, it feels like a distant memory that I can't quite place. I continue on, my feet carrying me deeper into the unknown, when suddenly, a structure comes into view. It's a ruin, long-dead and decrepit, but there's something about it that feels eerily familiar.As I draw closer, I realize with a start that this is a place I recognized, but until now, I was absolutely certain couldn't have possibly existed. It's a castle, one that I've seen countless times in my dreams, but never thought was real. The walls are crumbling, the once grand towers now reduced to rubble. Yet, despite its state of disrepair, there's something hauntingly beautiful about it.I walk closer, my heart pounding in my chest, and run my hand over the rough stone. It's cool to the touch, and I can feel the history seeping out of it. I imagine the battles that were fought here, the feasts that were held, the lives that were lived within these walls.As I explore further, I come across a courtyard, the flagstones cracked and overgrown with weeds. In the center, a fountain sits, dry and lifeless, its waters long since gone. I can almost hear the sound of laughter and the splashing of water, though, and I feel a pang of sadness that this place has been left to decay.Despite the ruin, there's still a sense of grandeur here, a feeling of majesty that can't be denied. I climb the crumbling stairs to the top of a tower, and look out over the countryside. The view is breathtaking, rolling hills stretching out as far as the eye can see.As I stand here, the wind whipping my hair and the sun beating down on my skin, I can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder. This place, this impossible place, is a reminder that there's still so much in the world that we don't understand, so much that we can't explain.",

One day, I was playing Assassin's Creed, my favorite game, when Sarah came home from class. She plopped down on the couch next to me and watched me play for a while.As I was sneaking around a medieval town, climbing buildings and taking out guards, Sarah suddenly looked at me with a strange expression.\"Wait a minute,\" she said, \"you're not just playing the game, are you? You're actually becoming the character!\"I was taken aback by her comment, but as I looked down at my hands, I realized that they were no longer my own. They were the hands of Altair, the game's protagonist.\"Whoa, what's going on?\" I asked, trying to sound calm despite my confusion.Sarah just shook her head in amazement. \"I don't know, but it's freaking cool! You're like a real-life Assassin!\"As I continued to play, I started to notice that my movements were becoming more fluid and graceful, just like Altair's. I could climb walls, leap across rooftops, and even wield a sword with ease.Sarah and I spent the rest of the afternoon playing game after game, and each time, I inherited the abilities and skills of the character I was playing. I was a master of World of Warcraft, a pro at Overwatch, and even a virtuoso at Dance Dance Revolution.But as the day went on, I started to realize that this newfound power came with a price.

The extraterrestrial beings, who came from a distant planet called Zorvath, landed their spaceship in the capital city of Japan.The Japanese government was both amazed and terrified as they watched the aliens step out of their spacecraft. The aliens were unlike anything they had ever seen before - they were tall, slender beings with large, almond-shaped eyes and long, spindly fingers.The leader of the alien delegation, who introduced himself as Zor-Tath, began to communicate with the Japanese government officials using a strange, high-pitched language. The officials were unable to understand what the aliens were saying, but they knew that this was a historic moment.As the news of the alien contact spread, the government of the United States was quick to react. The White House issued a statement expressing their offense that the aliens had not chosen to make contact with them first.\"We are the most powerful nation on Earth,\" said the White House spokesperson. \"It is only natural that any advanced civilization would want to establish contact with us first.\"The Japanese government, however, was not interested in getting into a fight with the Americans over the aliens. They politely declined the White House's demands, saying that they were happy to be the first country to establish contact with the aliens.The two governments went back and forth for several days, each trying to outdo the other in their attempts to win the favor of the aliens. But in the end, the aliens made it clear that they were not interested in taking sides.\"We come in peace,\" said Zor-Tath. \"We want to learn about your cultures and share our own knowledge with you. But we will not be used as pawns in your petty squabbles.\"The two governments were forced to put aside their differences and work together to establish a positive relationship with the aliens.",

They had studied it, analyzed it, and even inflicted it on themselves, all in the name of science and progress. But despite their advanced knowledge, they had never been able to understand why they had a tendency to hurt others of their own kind.At first, it was just small, petty cruelties. A child pulling the wings off a fly, a group of teenagers bullying a weaker classmate. But as time went on, the hurts grew more severe. Wars broke out over land, resources, and ideologies. People hurt each other for no reason other than because they could.As the centuries passed, humanity became more and more advanced. They built towering cities, harnessed the power of the universe, and even colonized other planets. But despite all their progress, they never managed to shake off their tendency to hurt each other.One day, a group of scientists decided to take a closer look at this phenomenon. They conducted experiments, analyzed data, and even observed other species to try and understand why humans were the only intelligent life form that hurt others of their kind.What they found was both surprising and disturbing. It seemed that humans had a unique ability to empathize with other living beings, but at the same time, they also had a strange desire to cause pain and suffering to those same beings.The scientists were baffled. They couldn't understand why humans would go out of their way to hurt others, even when there was nothing to gain from it. They conducted more experiments, tested different theories, but the answer remained elusive.As the years went by, humanity continued to hurt each other. They built weapons of mass destruction, started wars over petty differences, and even exploited and enslaved other species. All the while, the scientists continued to study and observe, trying to understand why humans were so prone to hurtful behavior.",

I was initially told the delivery would arrive in 45 minutes to an hour, but the food came knocking on my hotel room sooner than expected. nnThe complimentary mini garlic buns were cooled by that time. It was over-buttered but yummy nonetheless. It was a delight to see the whopping serving of pasta after not having anything to eat all day. Thankfully it was kept warm by the plastic container and comforting with every bite. The generous servings of angel hair was filled to the brim with juicy chicken slices, very few shrimps, mushrooms, roasted and hot peppers drenched in a mild marinara sauce. The flood of sweet and semi-savory marinara was not the ideal and the peppers also did not make an impression. The quality of the pasta was overcooked and oversoaked, but the pieces of chunky chicken were tender and delicious. The side salad did not look very fresh and was not newsworthy. nnI didn't get a chance to visit the venue to get a better impression of the establishment, but as a delivery service I thought it was fast while portions were very generous. Value wise, kudos to them for having a $5 children's menu for those at the ages 2-10. For my dish however, I still consider it overpriced for what was supposed to be their fanciest pasta dish. 2. 5 stars for the experience.",

We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills.. . yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later.. . that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion.. . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!",

The won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.

My boyfriend used to play in a band as does one of his best friends now. This was their favorite spot to hang out out because all of the (female) bartenders know and love them.

The bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night. I've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired. The drinks are poured strongly. At first I thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks, but now I realize they're just heavy handed. nnNothing here really sticks out for me. I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda. Those two are the most kick ass bartenders in Pittsburgh.

The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day! nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \"fishy\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level. nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna!",

I always recommend the food here to everyone I know whenever they say they're going to the Strip. It's cheap and delicious. This would be a five star rating if I wasn't considering the grocery store, but this place IS indeed a grocery store and not just a street vendor (unfortunately). nThe grocery store is very poorly organized, things are dusty, and many of the things don't have expiration dates. That's actually pretty typical of imported Asian food, but I was really skeptical about buying anything from the grocery store because no one really shops here (there are better competitors down the street, like Lotus Food Co) and that means that the food remained on the shelf for who knows how long. The first time my friend and I came here, she purchased a pack of mango mochi ice cream and found that it had freezer burn and smelled a bit off as well. The store manager/owner kindly refunded the purchase, which was nice, but I would still never buy anything. Also, compared to Lotus Food Co, some of the items in this store are more expensive. The mochi ice cream was definitely more expensive--I can't remember exactly how much, but after we realized that we bought a bad item, we went to Lotus Food Co and bought a box of mochi ice cream that was perfectly fine, delicious, and less expensive.",

Having grown up on the Chesapeake Bay and experiencing so many great waterfront resteraunts I had high hopes for this place. It could be so much better. nnPLEASE, if nothing else, clean that place before someone really gets sick! Probably one of the filthiest dining rooms I have seen in a long time. Really makes me wonder how dirty the kitchen is. The owners and managers can't be so blind not to see the decades worth of dust and cob-webs on all the junk and dead carcasses located throughout this place. nnReluctant to even give this place 1 star! Time for \"Kitchen Nightmare\" intervention maybe? nnUPDATE.. .. . nOkay, it now 7 hours after my not so tasty (questionably safe) lunch at T-Bones today and my stomach is still doing flip-flops even after a bout of diarrhea (sorry to give such detail but important to note). The health department really needs to take a much closer look at this place.. . honestly folks!",

The side of broccoli was just drizzle with soysauce and salty! the sesame chicken was average however I did enjoy how they didn't soak it in sauce.

You can even fish, but there are signs posted that say caution because the fish may have a high dosage of mercury. nnIf you are planning a reunion, this would probably be a great place to host it. Rent one of the areas, let people camp out, you are right next to the lake to rent kayaks in the spring and summer.. . you've got yourself one great family gathering spot! nnThe Nature Center was closed when I was there, but I'm sure one of these days I'll stop in.",

His social interactions with me continued to be strange. While he was never inappropriate, he was less than professional. When I told him that I had suffered from tight painful calves he said \"Yes! \" Again, not inappropriate but not professional. I have also never had a therapist that didnt tell me to undress to my comfort level. He just told me to undress and that he would be back  with a heat lamp. At this point, as a female about to undress for a large male, he didn't do anything to make sure that I felt comfortable. The entire interaction leading up to the massage was strange and uncomfortable. nThe massage itself was fine. At one point he made a slurping nose and then apologized for forgetting to swallow. The pressure was too much at times and when I told him that it hurt his response was, \"But it's so good for the tissue. \" I will not be going back and I wouldn't recommend him to a friend.

One friend chose the same as me except the potato soup and a 1/2 of aturkey club, and the other friend chose a cheesy baked potato. If you are familiar with this restaurant, which has many locations throughout the Charlotte area, you will remember that you must order at the counter. It was a very quick and friendly process at this location. Also, a nice older gentleman that comes around and ask you how you are doing, if he can be of any help, and asks if he can clear stuff away for you. Now the food part:  My roast beef sandwich was lacking in thickness of meat, and a bit fatty on the roast beef. My New England clam chowder was hot.. . it's hard to please a New Englander when it comes to chowda'.. . but not hardly any clams, too uniformed cut potatoes and lots of emulsifiers does not a chowder make. Now onto my friends plates. The potato soup was described as hot and creamy and the 1/2 a turkey club sandwich was quite large and nicely put together. The baked potato that my other friend had was gi-normous. I'm telling you, this thing could have been used as a regulation sized football. Where the heck do they find potatoes that big I wonder? Really, I had to do a triple take to see whether it was 2 potoatoes cleverly disguised as one, but it wasn't, it was just one big 'tater. Okay, I know, I'm going to far on the size of the potato, but boy did it look goooooooddd! It had 2 types of cheese, a nice cheddar cheese for color and a wonderful stringy mozzarella. nThe prices for all these items came up to about $25. 00. Really pretty good for 3 people needing a quick lunch. nI'll go back to McAlister's again, but I think, next time, I'll be ordering that pig skin of a potato!",

I'll give them the +1 for appearances. nn-2 stars: The food is terrible. TERRIBLE. After the WIS v UTEP game, the wife ordered boneless Buffalo chicken wings. They came out deep fried and hard, with almost no flavor -- there was NO BUFFALO SAUCE ON THE WINGS! (We think the B-sauce might have been fried onto the chicken, but, if so, the flavor was lost in frying). nn-1 star: The service was lacking. Following the game, with all 50+ people who had just come back on the Badger Bus, there were only 2 servers, and they were also the bartenders! Service was slow, haphazard, and careless -- the guy never once asked how the food was, nor did he ever actually stop at the table except long enough to take our order. Drinks were dropped on the fly, the food was all but thrown as he whizzed by. .. nnOverall, 2 stars. I'll go back for the Badger Bus and the bowling, but I will NEVER eat there again.",

I would definitely order this plate again, unless one of the other fish or specials was calling my name. Service was good and certainly better than I have had in the past here.

I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better. I think that if this location spent some more time and money they could live up to the standard that all the other locations do. Charlotte is a nice city and all the other hotels are more up to date. Omni would gain more business if they just did some minor changes",

After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance. nnAfter some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began. After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs. By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well. I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate. I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did. After wards i made a quick exit. nnThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here. I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least. Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment. A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation. It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me. On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well. The are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to you. nnYou've  been warned. nnJay",

Worse is that I asked for the fried sweet potato and it's now the frozen, pre-seasoned fast food type where it used to be simply real potato. nnThe prime rib was as rare as I asked but -as it's often the case- the chef had rubbed way too much salt on the slab before cooking it and there's no desalting it. Most people do like it prepared that way but what about those who don't or who have to cut their sodium intake? nnIt's way too obvious that it's a franchise and management cuts way too many corners for the prices they charge.

That's another thing I cannot comprehend about this place, you have two floors of space but if an event is not taking place you only use one floor causing people to be crammed around the bar by the main entrance (yes, I'm still complaining about that). nnKaraoke night here isn't as bad as other local establishments, people can actually sing. Drinks are reasonable priced. Bartenders are attentive. That is if you can make to the bar for a drink. nnOne bad drawback about this place is that every once in a while you have a random person roaming around asking if you want to buy drugs off them.

The savor crepes are served with a light salad with mandarins oranges and a citrus vinaigrette while the sweet crepes have whipped cream. nnSeriously, this place is amazing.

I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. nnThe first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear. ) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town. nnThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet! nnA final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation.

Sometimes it can get pretty loud. nnHowever, the food makes up for what lacks in terms of atmosphere. I love that they give unlimited table bread with your choice of butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Absolutely divine. nnI've tried three entrees: nn1) Cavatelli with lamb sausage - light sauce, very flavorful meatballs.

It actually had a slightly sweet flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut. My wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese. Nothing better than stuffing pork with pork, my friends. That was served with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh. nnThe old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice touch and got everyone going.

I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room.

We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop. What can I say, we like sushi. The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy. The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here. However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna. Everyone does a spicy tuna. At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll.

The lackluster atmosphere, disinterested staff, subpar food, high prices, and overwhelming noise level were all contributing factors to my decision to avoid this place in the future. There are plenty of other dining options in the area that offer a far superior experience for a similar price point. Bar Louie will not be seeing me as a returning customer anytime soon.",

Once we finally managed to place our orders, another lengthy wait ensued before our food arrived at the table.When the food did arrive, it was disappointing. My burger was overcooked and lacked flavor, while the accompanying fries were lukewarm and soggy. The presentation was also lackluster, as if it had been hastily thrown together. The portion sizes were underwhelming as well, especially considering the prices they charge.Furthermore, the overall ambiance of the restaurant was dull and uninspiring. The decor felt outdated, and the lighting was too harsh, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere.

The aroma of freshly baked bread and sizzling spices fills the air, promising delectable culinary delights. However, as you delve deeper into the dining experience, the shortcomings become apparent. The service, albeit polite, lacks efficiency and attentiveness, with long waiting times for both ordering and receiving dishes. The menu, while diverse, leans towards the pricier side, making it harder to justify the overall value. Moreover, the presentation of the dishes, though visually appealing, falls short in terms of portion size and flavor balance. The flavors, though promising at first, often lack the depth and complexity expected for a restaurant of this caliber. Additionally, the wine list, while extensive, could benefit from more affordable options to cater to a wider range of budgets. The lack of vegetarian and vegan options is also a drawback, as it limits the inclusivity of the menu. Furthermore, the noise level in the restaurant can be quite high, making it difficult to hold conversations without raising your voice.

It's understandable that a chain store would have a certain level of uniformity, but the lack of uniqueness left me wanting more.Another aspect that disappointed me was the customer service. The staff appeared indifferent and disinterested in helping customers. I had difficulty finding an associate who was willing to assist me with my inquiries, and when I finally did, their knowledge seemed limited and their attitude unenthusiastic. It was a stark contrast to the personalized assistance one would expect when seeking guidance for home improvement projects.On the positive side, the prices at this Home Depot were competitive. I did manage to find a few items that were reasonably priced, especially during their seasonal sales. However, the overall experience felt lacking, as if it was solely centered around the transaction rather than fostering a welcoming and enjoyable shopping environment.One redeeming quality was the store's cleanliness. Despite the uninspired atmosphere, the aisles were neatly organized, and there was no shortage of staff members dedicated to maintaining tidiness. I appreciated the effort put into keeping the store presentable, even if it couldn't compensate for the overall lackluster experience.",

        "text": "I'd like to echo the advice of another commenter: do not pre-pay. While it may seem convenient to pay upfront for a product or service, it often leaves you vulnerable and at the mercy of the provider. Time and time again, I've seen instances where pre-paying has led to disappointment and frustration.One of the main reasons to avoid pre-paying is that it relinquishes your ability to hold the provider accountable. Once they have your money, there's little incentive for them to prioritize your needs or deliver on their promises. It's always better to maintain some leverage by keeping your payment contingent upon satisfactory results.Furthermore, pre-paying can be financially risky. Circumstances change, businesses go under, and unforeseen events can derail plans. If you've already paid in full, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to recover your hard-earned money. Protecting your financial interests should always be a priority.Another drawback of pre-paying is that it limits your flexibility. Life is unpredictable, and we often need to make adjustments to our plans. By pre-paying, you lock yourself into a specific arrangement, leaving little room for changes or cancellations without potentially losing money. Opting for payment upon completion or after receiving the product allows for greater adaptability.Moreover, pre-paying can result in a diminished level of service. Providers may feel less obligated to go the extra mile or provide top-notch assistance if they have already received payment in full. In many cases, the quality of service tends to decline once the transaction is complete, leaving you feeling dissatisfied and taken advantage of.Additionally, pre-paying can make it challenging to address any issues that may arise. Suppose you've already paid before realizing that there are defects, problems, or discrepancies. In that case, resolving these matters can become a daunting task.",

The plot seemed promising at first, but the execution left much to be desired. The pacing was inconsistent, with some scenes dragging on while others felt rushed and underdeveloped.Furthermore, the character development was lacking. The protagonist felt one-dimensional, and it was difficult to empathize with their journey. The supporting cast had potential, but they were severely underutilized, resulting in missed opportunities to explore their stories and motivations.From a technical standpoint, the cinematography was decent, showcasing breathtaking visuals in certain sequences. However, the editing was choppy, making it hard to follow the narrative at times. Additionally, the sound mixing was imbalanced, with the dialogue often getting drowned out by the overpowering background score.The film's attempt at incorporating humor fell flat as well. The jokes felt forced and failed to elicit genuine laughter. It seemed like the comedic relief was added hastily, without much thought to its integration within the overall tone of the film.On the positive side, the production design was impressive, capturing the essence of the story's setting effectively. The costumes and set pieces were meticulously crafted, enhancing the visual appeal of the movie. The soundtrack, although overshadowed by the flawed sound mixing, had a few standout tracks that added depth to certain scenes.Despite its shortcomings, the movie did manage to deliver some captivating action sequences. The choreography and special effects were commendable in those moments, providing thrilling and visually engaging sequences that momentarily grabbed my attention.It's worth noting that the film did touch upon relevant societal issues. It attempted to address thought-provoking themes, tackling subjects such as identity and the consequences of unchecked power.",

The trail was well-maintained, with occasional markers guiding our way.As we ascended higher, the landscape unfolded before us, revealing stunning panoramas of majestic peaks and verdant valleys. Each step propelled us further into the heart of nature's grandeur. The sound of rushing water drew us to a hidden waterfall cascading down a moss-covered rockface, offering a refreshing break.After rejuvenating ourselves, we continued our ascent, encountering occasional wildlife along the way. A graceful deer crossed our path, seemingly unfazed by our presence. The climb grew more challenging as we reached steeper terrain, requiring careful navigation and teamwork. Our determination and mutual support strengthened the bond between us, making the experience even more memorable.Hours later, we conquered the summit, greeted by an awe-inspiring panorama that made the arduous journey worth every drop of sweat. We found a perfect vantage point to witness the setting sun painting the sky in hues of gold and pink. It was a magical moment, etching itself into our memories forever.With spirits uplifted, we began our descent, reflecting on the incredible adventure we had shared. The mountain had tested our physical and mental strength, but it had also rewarded us with a sense of accomplishment and a newfound appreciation for the beauty of the natural world.As nightfall approached, we returned to the base, tired but satisfied.

As I walked through the doors of the store, I couldn't help but notice the nostalgic ambiance that enveloped the space. The familiar blue and white color scheme brought back memories of my childhood shopping trips. However, as I ventured deeper into the store, it became apparent that Kmart was struggling to keep up with the changing times.The once bustling aisles now appeared sparse, with shelves displaying a limited selection of products. It seemed as though Kmart had lost its competitive edge against online retailers and larger chain stores. The lack of modernization was evident in the outdated displays and cramped layout, making it difficult to navigate through the cluttered sections.I noticed that the staff seemed disengaged and unenthusiastic, which further contributed to the lackluster shopping experience. There was a noticeable absence of customer service, leaving me feeling as though I was simply another anonymous face in the crowd.Despite its shortcomings, Kmart still managed to retain some loyal customers, evident by a few people browsing the aisles. The store did have its redeeming qualities, such as an impressive selection of affordable home goods and discounted clothing items. Bargain hunters might still find solace in the store's wide range of lower-priced products.One aspect that stood out to me was the clearance section, where I stumbled upon some great deals on discontinued items. However, the overall organization of the store made it challenging to locate specific items or even find assistance when needed.As I made my way to the checkout counter, I couldn't help but feel a tinge of sadness. Kmart, once an icon of American retail, was now a faded relic of the past. The decline of this once-thriving store mirrored the changing landscape of the retail industry.In conclusion, while Darren's review sparked my curiosity, my personal experience at Kmart left much to be desired.",

The slow-braised veal shank was incredibly tender, practically falling off the bone, and the gremolata topping added a refreshing tanginess to the dish. It was accompanied by a creamy saffron risotto that was absolutely heavenly. The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that every bite was a satisfying experience.To complete my meal, I indulged in a traditional tiramisu, and it was the perfect finale.

From the moment I walked into their store, the lack of professionalism was evident. The staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful, making it clear that customer satisfaction was not their priority.The selection of tuxedos was extremely limited, and the ones they did have were outdated and in poor condition. It felt like they hadn't updated their inventory in years. The fitting process was a nightmare as well. The staff didn't take accurate measurements, leaving me with a poorly fitted tuxedo that looked awkward and uncomfortable.On top of that, the tuxedo they provided was dirty and had noticeable stains. It was as if they hadn't bothered to clean it before renting it out. When I pointed out the issue, they seemed indifferent and didn't offer any solution or apology.To make matters worse, the tuxedo started falling apart during the event. The buttons were loose, and the seams were coming undone. It was embarrassing and ruined the entire evening for me. I never expected a rental service to provide such low-quality garments.The pricing was also exorbitant for the poor quality they delivered. I could have rented a much better tuxedo from a different place at a lower price. It's clear that this rental service is taking advantage of customers by charging high rates for subpar products.The customer service was equally abysmal. When I called to express my dissatisfaction and request a refund, I was met with rude and unhelpful representatives. They refused to acknowledge their mistakes or take any responsibility for the terrible experience I had.In conclusion, I strongly advise against using this tuxedo rental service. The lack of professionalism, poor selection, dirty and ill-fitted tuxedos, and unresponsive customer service make it a complete waste of time and money.",

I had been eagerly anticipating my dinner at this renowned teppanyaki restaurant, having heard rave reviews from friends and colleagues. However, my recent visit left me extremely disappointed and frustrated. To begin with, the service was shockingly slow and inattentive. Despite making a reservation well in advance, my party and I were kept waiting for nearly 30 minutes before being seated. The hostess seemed overwhelmed and disorganized, and it was clear that she lacked the necessary skills to efficiently manage the seating arrangements.Once we were finally seated, we waited eagerly for our chef to arrive at the table and begin preparing our meal. However, it took an incredibly long time for anyone to acknowledge our presence. The lack of communication from the staff only added to our growing frustration, as we grew hungrier by the minute.When the chef finally arrived, his lackluster performance further dampened our spirits. He seemed disinterested and unenthusiastic, merely going through the motions without any of the flair and showmanship we had come to expect from a teppanyaki chef. The food itself was mediocre at best, with the flavors lacking depth and the ingredients appearing subpar.Furthermore, the once vibrant and lively atmosphere of the restaurant seemed strangely dull that night. The background music was barely audible, and the absence of cheerful chatter and laughter made the experience feel strangely somber. It was as if the soul of the restaurant had taken an unwelcome hiatus.As the evening progressed, we found ourselves constantly seeking the attention of the waitstaff, who seemed more interested in conversing amongst themselves than tending to the needs of the diners. Our requests for additional condiments and refills fell on deaf ears, leaving us feeling neglected and disheartened.",

The moment we walked in, we were greeted with the mouthwatering aroma of sizzling meats and freshly baked bread. The atmosphere was lively, bustling with locals and tourists alike, creating a vibrant energy that added to the overall experience.The menu at Primanti Bros is a carnivore's dream come true. With a wide selection of sandwiches piled high with meat, cheese, and coleslaw, it's hard to decide where to begin. I opted for their classic \"Almost Famous\" sandwich, which featured thick cuts of pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, and a generous helping of their signature coleslaw, all sandwiched between two slices of soft Italian bread. Each bite was a perfect balance of flavors and textures, with the tanginess of the coleslaw complementing the rich, savory pastrami.What sets Primanti Bros apart from other sandwich joints is their unique addition of fries directly into the sandwich. This unconventional twist adds an extra layer of indulgence and a satisfying crunch to every bite. The fries were perfectly cooked, golden and crispy on the outside, while still tender on the inside. It's a deliciously messy experience that you quickly get the hang of, and it's worth every napkin you go through.Apart from their famous sandwiches, Primanti Bros also offers a variety of other dishes to satisfy different cravings. Their loaded nachos were a hit at our table, piled high with melted cheese, tangy jalapeños, and a heaping serving of their homemade chili. The combination of flavors was fantastic and made for a great sharable appetizer.The service at Primanti Bros was friendly and efficient, with the staff providing helpful recommendations and ensuring our glasses were always filled. The wait for a table was understandable given the restaurant's popularity, but it was well worth it once we were seated.",

Our server, who never introduced herself or even cracked a smile the entire time she \"waited\" on us, pretty much ruined the whole dining experience. There were only two other tables occupied in the entire restaurant, so it's not like she was slammed. She pretty much ignored us the entire time, which was super annoying since we were starving and thirsty.We finally flagged her down to order drinks and an appetizer and she never came back to check on us once during the entire meal. My husband had to get up and go to the bar to get our own drinks. When the food finally arrived, it was only lukewarm at best and my husband's burger was so overcooked it was like eating cardboard. My fish and chips were okay but nothing special.To top off the whole horrible experience, when we went to pay the bill, she had the audacity to ask us how everything was. We told her the service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best and she didn't even apologize or offer to make it right. We will never be back!The only saving grace was the atmosphere. The restaurant itself is really nice, very clean and decorated in a fun, nautical theme. It's such a shame that the service and food were so bad because we were really looking forward to making this our new regular spot.Overall, I would definitely not recommend the Tip Top Tavern to anyone. There are much better options out there for food and service.",

We were looking for a toilet that was comfortable, easy to clean, and affordable. This toilet checked all of those boxes. It's also very stylish, which is a plus.We've had the toilet for a few weeks now, and we're very happy with it. It's comfortable to sit on, and it flushes well. It's also very easy to clean.

They were hesitant because they are vegetarian, but I assured them that there would be plenty of options. They were right to be skeptical; there was only one vegetarian entree on the menu, and it was a spicy tofu dish. It didn’t sound very good, so one of our friends decided to just get a side of white rice, while the other had an egg foo yung. I ordered the sesame chicken, which our server said was the most popular dish on the menu. He also brought a big bowl of steaming white rice for the three of us to share.We started with an order of spring rolls which were deep fried to a golden brown and served with the typical dipping sauce. They were delicious. Our entrees also came fairly quickly. My sesame chicken was tasty, but the breading was a little thick. The white rice was fluffy and moist, just like it should be. Our friend with the white rice said that it was cooked perfectly. The egg foo yung was light and fluffy with plenty of vegetables. The tofu was nicely fried, but it was just too spicy for my friend. Our server was very attentive and friendly. He kept our water glasses full and even brought us more white rice when we asked.All in all, our experience was okay. The service was good, and the spring rolls, sesame chicken and white rice were delicious. However, there weren't many vegetarian options and the tofu dish was too spicy, so I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to vegetarians.",

The menu features all the classic Cajun dishes like gumbo, jambalaya and shrimp etouffee, as well as weekly specials that use fresh local ingredients. On my last visit I tried the crawfish etouffee which was full of flavor from the rich roux and plump crawfish. The portion sizes are generous without being overwhelming so you can try several dishes in one meal. In addition to the entrees, I love starting with the bread pudding soup which is a unique and delicious twist on the classic dessert. Whether dining in or taking out, my food has always been delivered hot and fresh. The restaurant maintains a casual yet elegant atmosphere with its bayou inspired decor. I've dined there with groups of friends and family celebrating special occasions with great success.

Strange noises and sightings immediately start to happen. It seems this house has a dark past that is now haunting the new family. As the movie progresses, the paranormal activity escalates into truly frightening encounters. Objects start moving on their own and disturbing messages appear on the walls.  No one in the family is safe from the malicious spirits. The family desperately tries to escape the house but it seems the entity is too powerful. I found myself unable to look away despite how scary some of the scenes were. By the end I felt completely unsettled and on edge.

We were seated right away even though it was pretty busy for a Monday. The decor had an upbeat, modern vibe which I thought fit well with the menu. We started by sharing an appetizer of truffle fries that were topped with Parmesan and herbs. Those fries were insanely good, the perfect combination of crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. For our mains, I had the barbecue chicken sandwich which came with coleslaw and chips. It was a generous portion and everything was very fresh tasting. My wife enjoyed the fish tacos that featured seasoned mahi mahi. My dad chose the burger which he said was one of the juiciest he's had. Grandpa stuck with something lighter and opted for the soup and salad combo. The server was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. I had a local craft beer to drink that went well with the food. Overall we were all very satisfied with our choices and the experience. The prices were also reasonable for the quality and portion sizes. I'll have to come back next time I'm in Charlotte to try something different from the menu. This place would be a great choice for both dining in or getting takeout.

They spent quite a while reading all the information panels and observing the dinosaurs move. The science gallery allowed for many hands-on experiments that kept everyone engaged. One exhibit let us create circuits to light up different colored bulbs. In the nature center we saw taxidermy animals and got to touch seashells and fossils. The IMAX theater was showing a new documentary about national parks that provided beautiful scenery on their huge three-story screen. After the movie we checked out the 4D motion theater with its wind and water special effects. For lunch we ate in the cafeteria while looking out over the charter plaza. In the afternoon we visited the art studio where kids were doing craft projects. The body works area let us learn about human anatomy through models and interactives.

Save your appetite and dollars for one of the numerous superior options in this vibrant city center.In summary, this establishment provides mediocre fare amidst a wealth of excellent choices in uptown Charlotte.

Carowinds, in comparison, felt amateurish with its aging rides and tired theming. That said, I have to acknowledge that the parks in Orlando are on another level when it comes to budget. For being located in a much smaller city, Carowinds still manages to offer up a decent selection of rollercoasters and other rides to keep guests entertained for the day. While the theming leaves something to be desired, I appreciated some of the park's unique rides that I hadn't experienced elsewhere like the Flying Comets and Wooden Warrior. It was also fun to see elements of both the Carolinas represented throughout the park. The small town vibes of the boardwalk area provide a nice break from the busier sections of the park. That said, the park felt a bit tired and run-down in parts.Foot traffic was also noticeably lighter than what I'm used to at bigger name parks. This meant shorter lines which allowed us to experience more rides in a day. However, it also contributed to an emptier atmosphere that lackluster theming doesn't help. With some improvements and investments, I think Carowinds has potential to be a more polished regional park. As it stands now, Orlando veterans may find it underwhelming in comparison.

Performance areas were cleanly maintained with regulated occupancy to avoid overcrowding. Security was discreetly present yet clearly monitoring for any inappropriate conduct.Overall, it seemed to be operated as a professional adult venue.

The direction was superb - every scene was crafted to perfection and flowed beautifully into the next. The cinematography took the viewer right into the heart of the action. The acting from the entire cast was nothing short of breathtaking. Each performer brought their character to life in a way that felt truly authentic. It's clear everyone involved brought their A-game and worked incredibly hard to make this vision a reality. About halfway through the movie I was stunned by a plot twist I did not see coming. It completely changed the trajectory of the story in an exciting new direction. The film packs a real emotional punch and left me thinking about the themes long after the credits rolled. I will definitely be seeing it again and exploring all the hidden details I may have missed the first time. This is absolutely one of the best movies of the year and sets a very high bar for others to reach. I walked out of the theater on an unbelievable high and can't recommend it enough.",

It was my first real job in publishing and I was thrilled with the opportunity to learn from seasoned editors. The offices were located in Greenwich Village and I enjoyed taking walks through the neighborhood during my lunch breaks. I was exposed to many talented writers during my time there as manuscripts crossed my desk. One of my main duties was copyediting and I found the work tedious at times but important for improving the content. The senior editors were demanding but also supportive of newcomers like myself trying to break into the field. Throughout my training, I absorbed as much knowledge as possible about the publishing process. By summer, I felt more comfortable in my role and less anxious about mistakes. However, the position was only temporary which made it bittersweet knowing it would end. In late August, I helped pack up the office for summer vacation closures with mixed emotions. It was exciting to start a new chapter but sad to say goodbye to the tight-knit team. I kept in touch with some of my coworkers after leaving and remain grateful for that initial foothold in New York publishing. To this day, I look back fondly on my brief career stint at Harper's as an invaluable learning experience at the start of my path.",

There seemed to be almost as many shrimp as bread in the sandwich, which I appreciated. In addition to the shrimp, the Po Boy also included lettuce, tomato, pickle, and aCreole sauce. The sauce provided a nice mix of spicy and savory flavors that complemented the shrimp perfectly. The bread was soft and fresh, not at all dry or stale. I was able to finish the whole Po Boy myself without feeling too full afterwards. The portion size was just right in my opinion. Overall I was very satisfied with this shrimp Po Boy and would order it again on my next visit to this restaurant. The price was also reasonable for the large amount of food included. I would recommend the Shrimp Po Boo to anyone wanting a tasty lunch in this part of town.",

The interior layout is still the same, with the long wooden bar on the right and tables and booths on the left. They've updated some of the lighting and flooring materials, but kept the classic bar atmosphere. The clientele seemed similar, a good mix of locals, tourists, and businesspeople. It was a Wednesday evening and they had a decent crowd for a weeknight. The cover band was playing popular rock and country hits to keep people entertained. The drinks menu had evolved some with more craft cocktail options added. I ordered their signature whiskey sour which was well made as I remember. We also got an order of their smoked wings which were flavorful with a nice burn from the seasoning. Service from the bartenders was attentive without being overbearing. Prices had risen some but were still reasonable for a neighborhood bar in Buckhead. The bathroom facilities were clean if a bit small and dated. Overall the Buckhead Saloon has kept much of its classic charm while slowly updating elements over the years. It remains a solid local dive bar and watering hole in the bustling Buckhead area. Unless they make drastic changes, it will maintain its role for many more years to come. The consistency and familiarity are part of its enduring appeal to locals and visitors alike.",

The restaurant delivers on both accounts by offering a plethora of classic Chinese dishes made fresh and served at reasonable price points. While the dining room is small and basic, it gets busy at meal times with patrons seeking an affordable bite. Menu standouts include the house lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, and beef and broccoli—all generous portions for the price. Customer favorites also consist of the steamed dumplings and house chow mein, though quality does vary slightly dish to dish. For a casual neighborhood eatery, Cherry House gets most recipes right and satisfies cravings without blowing the budget. However, those seeking premium or unusually-spiced Chinese cuisine would be better off exploring pricier options elsewhere. Atmosphere and service are simply no-frills; the focus is on getting food in and out quickly for dine-in or takeout. While not the most luxurious dining experience, Cherry House fulfills its function of budget-friendly Chinese without compromising too much on taste. It remains a reliable fallback during time crunches or when funds are tight. Overall, Cherry House delivers on the quick, inexpensive Chinese food it advertises, making it a worthy choice for the price. Just don't expect cutting-edge cuisine or lavish ambiance.",

This location has an energetic vibe perfect for catching games or hanging out with friends. The menu features delicious brick oven pizzas along with starters, salads, sandwiches and desserts that hit the spot. On game days the atmosphere is festive with fans cheering on their favorite teams. Whether dining in their spacious dining room or outside on the patio, the service is always friendly and attentive. As an added bonus they have a full bar serving craft beers, specialty cocktails and wines by the glass. The pizzas are made fresh daily with high quality ingredients - it's hard to go wrong with any selection. During halftime or time outs the lines can get long but they do a great job keeping wait times reasonable. My favorite is their Margherita pizza - the fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil shine through. They also have gluten-free and veggie options for those with dietary needs or preferences. For dessert their brownies and cookies satisfy any sweet tooth. On busier nights getting a table may require a wait but they offer bar seating and the chance to enjoy a drink while you watch the game. The outdoor space is dog friendly which is a plus. Prices are very fair for the quality and portion sizes you get. Whether you're downtown for business or fun, Brixx is always a reliable choice for good food and times with friends old and new. It's one of the signature places to visit when in uptown Charlotte. I leave full and satisfied each time I dine here. The staff works hard to ensure everyone has a great experience. This location is a go-to hangout any time of year. Brixx upholds consistently high standards in food, atmosphere and service - they have gained many loyal local fans.",

First stop was a trendy new cocktail bar downtown where we sampled innovative mixes and appetizers. The atmosphere was lively and the people-watching entertaining.

Feeling peckish after drinking and dancing the night away, we ventured to a late-night restaurant renowned for its comfort food. The menu did not disappoint with southern specialties that warmed our souls. Refueled, it was on to a buzzing nightclub where dancing and mingling stretched into the wee hours.

Returning to the penthouse was like stepping into an oasis of calm after the lively night outside. Waking late the next morning, we stretched out on the spacious balcony enjoying coffee with views of the sparkling ocean.

We had to ask for refills on our drinks multiple times since the server forgot about our table. The manager was conveniently missing whenever we tried to complain. After two hours of terrible service, we finally got our check which had mistakes and unauthorized charges. When we pointed out the issues to the server, he became rude and dismissive. We asked to speak to a manager who was also rude and unapologetic about the horrible experience. Other tables around us seemed to be having similar problems, waiting a long time for slow service. The restaurant was only half full so there was no reason for such slow service. The food itself was mediocre at best and not worth such a long wait. We will not be returning to this restaurant and will be sure to warn others about our experience. The staff and management need serious training in customer service and problem solving. I'm surprised this restaurant is still in business with the level of terrible service we received. No one else there seemed to care about addressing customers' problems and complaints in a timely manner. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice but that does not make up for the truly poor customer service from start to finish. I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone and feel bad for others who may experience similar issues here. Management should make customer service and satisfaction a top priority instead of ignoring customer problems.

The first was Wilmington International Airport (ILM) in Wilmington, North Carolina. ILM is a medium hub airport that serves the Wilmington metro area with around 300 flights per week. The airport has two asphalt runways and one terminal building with 5 gates. Some of the airlines that fly into ILM include American, Delta, and United with service to hubs like Charlotte, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. Another airport was Florence Regional Airport (FLO) in Florence, South Carolina. FLO is a smaller airport that mainly handles regional flights on communities like American Eagle. The airport only has one runway and a modest terminal building. Other airports in the area like Myrtle Beach International and Raleigh-Durham International see much larger operations in comparison. Both ILM and FLO provide convenient air access for their local communities, though flights and destinations are more limited than at major hub airports.

With modern decor and furnishings, the dining area feels refreshingly upgraded from the usual fast food restaurant. Booths and tables are made of dark wood with comfortable padded seating. Various wall art and plants add personality to the space. Soft background music plays to mask the usual restaurant sounds. Staff are nicely dressed and attentive to keeping the dining area tidy. Menus are displayed clearly on digital screens to see options without waiting in line. Overall, the interior makes for a more pleasant dining experience than other area locations.",

Finally after a few minutes they seemed to notice me and she came over to take my order. However, she still seemed distracted and in a rush to get back to her conversation. She didn't look at me when I was speaking and had to ask me to repeat parts of my order. The food came out relatively quickly but it was only lukewarm, likely because it had been sitting waiting for her to take my order. Overall the experience left me quite dissatisfied and feeling neglected as a customer. I think businesses need to train their employees to prioritize customer service over socializing, especially when there are customers waiting. In the future I will likely not return to this location if the level of service does not improve. It's also concerning that management allows employees to chat for so long without addressing customers first. A good customer experience is key to retaining loyal patrons and word-of-mouth referrals. This location may want to reconsider their employee and service policies if they want repeat customers.",

Dipping bread and fresh vegetables into the communal fondue brings people together in a way that individual plates cannot. The careful coordination needed to fondue without spilling requires teamwork and laughter. Afterward, fingers and lips coated in greasy remnants of the feast, all concerns fade except reminiscing on the fun evening shared.

My husband chose the beet salad which he said was fresh and colorful. The main courses arrived next, I had the herb roasted chicken which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were lush and buttery. My dining companion selected the salmon filet that came with sautéed vegetables, he said the fish was cooked to perfection. For our third course, we both picked the cheese plate to share which offered a nice variety of soft and hard cheeses. We were already starting to feel full at this point but didn't want to skip the dessert course. I went with the crème brûlée that was topped with crisp sugar and had just the right consistency underneath. My partner chose the chocolate mousse that was light and airy with a rich chocolate flavor. The special ended up being a very good value for the price as we left fully satisified. The service throughout the meal was attentive without being overbearing. I would definitely return for restaurant week again next year and recommend it to friends. Overall it was a very pleasant dining experience in a comfortable atmosphere. I'm glad we opted for the special as it allowed us to sample multiple dishes without huge individual prices. It's clear that the kitchen takes pride in using fresh, high-quality ingredients. I look forward to returning for a regular dinner outside of restaurant week to experience more items on the menu.

The on hold music is terrible, it seems to be some kind of elevator-esque muzak playing on repeat every 3 minutes. I have counted that it takes exactly 143 seconds for the song to start over again. I am contemplating just hanging up at this point but I really need to get this issue resolved. I can't believe that with a major company like TWC it is this difficult just to speak to a actual person. The automated system never seems to understand what I say no matter how clearly I enunciate the options. This is beyond frustrating, aren't customer service and satisfaction supposed to be a priority for these types of companies? I'm sure I am not the only one with these terrible hold times and unhelpful automated systems. TWC must be losing customers left and right with this poor level of service, I know I will be looking to switch providers if I ever get off hold this time. My issue has now been ongoing for 3 days with no resolution in sight. At this point I am considering writing a sternly worded letter of complaint to TWC management to voice how unacceptable this customer experience has been. Enough is enough, I have spent over 2 hours on hold between these last two days trying to accomplish what should take 5 minutes tops with a live agent. I am guessing I will soon hit the 1 hour mark of wait time for this current call, at which point I think I will lose my patience and sanity. This review serves as a major warning for anyone considering TWC- look elsewhere or prepare for frustrations galore if you sign up with them. I can only hope that next time I call there is a miracle and I don't have to endure these long pointless holds. Ending on a hopeful note, fingers crossed the next agent can help me and end this nightmare customer service experience!",

With over 20 slides, a massive wave pool, and a lazy river circling the entire facility, thrill-seekers will be overwhelmed with options. My family spent the whole day taking turns riding the slides like the Corkscrew, which twists riders around before sending them down at high speeds. The wave pool is impressive for its size, with waves reaching several feet high every few minutes. We enjoyed relaxing on tubes along the lazy river, taking in beautiful views of the surrounding landscape as we gently floated along. All the slides have height restrictions to ensure safety, but even younger visitors can join in the fun at slides like the Tadpole which is a simple straight slide great for beginners. The water park also has a large sandy beach entry area perfect for relaxing in the sun or playing beach games like volleyball. During lunch one day we ate at the full service restaurant right in the water park, which conveniently let us eat together as a group. The food and service were both good though a bit overpriced as is typical for a theme park location. Staff is very attentive, with plenty of lifeguards on duty to monitor guests in the pools and slides. The water temperature was always comfortable, neither too cold nor too hot. On busier days, expect longer lines for the most popular slides, but there are usually alternate slides and attractions with little to no wait. Overall the water park provided a full day's worth of exciting activities for all ages. While expensive for admission, it's undoubtedly the best part of staying at this resort. The water park keeps families entertained for hours on end, making it a real highlight for families seeking a memorable summer getaway.",

The Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is a surprisingly scenic and enjoyable airport experience. There is plenty of natural light pouring through the large windows that line the concourses. Trees and plants are placed throughout to make the interior feel almost park-like at times. The art program has commissioned many local Pacific Northwest artists to display their works, providing colorful insights into the region. Good local coffee and snack options abound to keep hungry and weary travelers satisfied. Even the walk between terminals is pleasant, following an underground walkway with more natural elements incorporated into the design. Signage is clear and intuitive to help passengers find their ways. Security lines usually move quickly thanks to the many checkpoints that are often open. Once airside, it's fun to people watch from the windows facing the tarmac and see all the different planes on the taxiways and runways. On nice days, the majestic Mt. Rainier is often visible on the horizon as a beautiful backdrop. I've never had a truly bad travel experience departing or connecting through Seattle-Tacoma Airport. It's easy to see why it has consistently ranked high in customer satisfaction and quality surveys for mid-sized airports. Even the smaller regional carriers have amenities like power outlets at each seat. The airport does a great job feeling comfortable without losing its functional, efficient purpose. Overall, Sea-Tac provides a delightfully stress-free experience compared to other major hubs around the country.",

While it may take some time for this new team to become a playoff contender, they play with grit and have shown flashes of brilliance against top opponents. The Buzz City faithful have really embraced their team again and turned Games Nights into electric atmospheres at the Time Warner Cable Arena. It will be interesting to see how high-scoring guard Kemba Walker leads his teammates and progresses in his role as the team's star player. This season represents a new beginning for basketball in Charlotte as a new generation of fans get behind their Hornets. If the young core continues to develop together, the future looks bright for this franchise to once again compete for championships.

There never seems to be enough seats available either so you often end up standing around. Despite the busyness, the staff usually do a great job of getting people where they need to go. For the most part things ran pretty smoothly on my trips here. While a busy airport isn't always ideal, it does say something positive about the airport's popularity and usage. The number of flights and travelers also means this airport serves as a major transportation hub. When it's time to head home it's also reassuring to know you have lots of flight options. Although crowded, the variety of dining and retail options does help pass the time. It was interesting people watching the mix of travelers passing through. My one complaint would be that WiFi can get bogged down at times due to high traffic. It would be nice if they added more charging stations too. Still, overall this airport gets you where you need to go reliably even if it's not always the most relaxing experience.

Their website and billing are an endless source of confusion and frustration as well. It's nearly impossible to get an accurate bill or make meaningful changes to your account online.

If another provider offered service here I would switch immediately, no matter the cost, just to get away from the poor service and outdated equipment.

The reservation was confirmed instantly which eliminated any worries about the time slot not being held.

I'll gladly pay the small fee OT charges per reservation since it saves me so much time and hassle compared to calling restaurants directly. Recently I even used OT while traveling out of town to find a spot for dinner on short notice - it worked just as smoothly in another city. The ability to add diners and make last minute changes from the app is also extremely convenient. I'm signed up for notification emails that alert me to newly available times, which has allowed me to snag hard-to-get reservations before they disappear. All my dining companions are now using OT as well since they've seen first hand how seamless the process is when reserving through the app. It's nice to not have to stress over logistics and just concentrate on enjoying a good meal with friends and family. OT has truly changed the way I experience restaurants by taking away all the usual irritation of securing a reservation. I can't recommend the app highly enough to anyone tired of long wait times or endless call transferring at reservation lines.

BBQ, burgers, and hot dogs, all slathered in a tangy, vinegar-based sauce that'll make your taste buds do the cha cha slide. And don't forget the sides: onion rings that'll make your mouth sing, crispy bacon that'll make your arteries clog just thinking about it, and sweet potato fries that'll transport you straight to the antebellum South.But the real star of the show is the staff. Friendly doesn't even begin to cover it. These folks are like family, and they'll treat you like you're sitting at their dinner table. And get this - they still use a cash register from the 70s! It's like they're stuck in a bygone era, and I mean that in the best possible way.Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Is it worth the price?\" Well, let me tell you, it's a bargain. Most meals are under $10, and the portion sizes? Generous. You'll be stuffed by the time you leave, guaranteed.All in all, Green's Lunch is a must-visit if you're in the area. It's like a culinary time capsule that'll transport you back to a simpler time. So grab a bottle of RC Cola, put a nickel in the jukebox, and get ready for a meal that'll make your taste buds do the twist. And don't forget to tell 'em AsYouWishReviews sent you!Five stars? You bet your sweet bippy it's five stars! This place is the real deal.",

The shelves are often empty or disorganized, and the inventory seems to change daily.The staff is unhelpful and unfriendly, never bothering to answer questions or help with finding items. When you finally find what you need, the checkout process is slow and inefficient, with long lines and ancient payment machines.The prices are outrageous, with even the most basic items costing way more than they should. The store's return policy is confusing and difficult to navigate, making it hard to get a refund or exchange.Despite the frustration, the store is always crowded, with people seemingly willing to put up with the poor service and high prices. The parking lot is small and congested, making it hard to find a spot and difficult to leave.Overall, shopping at this store is a nightmare, with poor organization, unhelpful staff, high prices, and a chaotic environment.

We ended up going to a different pho restaurant every day during our week-long trip. My dad would always order the largest size, and he'd always finish every last drop. It was hilarious to see how much he loved it. Even now, whenever we talk, he brings up how much he misses pho. I'm so glad I got to introduce him to something he enjoys so much. It's become a special bond between us. I've tried pho in other cities, but none compare to the ones in California. I'm glad I got to share that experience with my dad. Now, every time I go back to California, I know I'll be getting my dad's request for pho. It's a running joke between us now, but it's something I cherish. I'm so glad I got to turn my dad onto something so delicious. It's a memory I'll always treasure.",

I squeezed a bit of lime over the meat, and the burst of citrus flavor complemented the rich, savory steak beautifully.

It was cooked to a perfect juiciness, with just a hint of smokiness from the grill. The shrimp were paired with a tangy, slightly spicy sauce that left me wanting more. Before I knew it, I had polished off both tacos and was eyeing the dessert menu.The Churros caught my eye, and I couldn't resist ordering a plate.

The green curry had a nice balance of spicy and sweet notes, while the Pad Thai was cooked to a perfect texture, with a subtle sweetness from the tamarind sauce. We also ordered a side of steamed rice, which was fluffy and well-seasoned. Overall, the food at Lemon Grass was delicious and well-executed, with generous portions and reasonable prices. The restaurant's attention to detail and commitment to quality made for a memorable dining experience. We would definitely recommend Lemon Grass to anyone looking for excellent Thai cuisine in a welcoming atmosphere.",

Could I really provide a fair and informative review of something so advanced?But I'm always up for a challenge, so I decided to give it a shot. And let me tell you, this AI assistant is something else. It's like having a personal assistant who's always at your beck and call, ready to answer any question or perform any task you throw at it. And the best part? It's incredibly easy to use, even for a techno-phobe like me.I started off by asking it some basic questions, like the weather and the time. And to my surprise, it answered correctly and quickly, without any hesitation. I then moved on to some more complex tasks, like setting reminders and sending emails. Again, the AI assistant performed flawlessly, never once faltering or making a mistake.One of the things that really impressed me was its ability to understand natural language. I could ask it questions in my own words, using colloquial expressions and idioms, and it would still understand what I was asking. It was almost like talking to a real person, except that this AI assistant was always available and never got tired or grumpy.Another feature that I found particularly useful was its ability to learn and adapt. Over time, it began to recognize my habits and preferences, and would offer suggestions and recommendations based on that information. It was like having my own personal assistant, tailored specifically to my needs and preferences.Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning a few drawbacks.

Our server, a friendly and knowledgeable young woman, greeted us with a warm smile and showed us to our table.The menu offered a diverse selection of traditional Italian dishes, including pasta, seafood, and meat options. We started with the antipasto platter, which was overflowing with cured meats, cheeses, olives, and vegetables. The flavors were rich and explosive, with each item complementing the others perfectly.For my main course, I chose the gnocchi, which was made fresh in-house and served with a rich tomato sauce. The gnocchi were light and fluffy, with a slight crunch from the potato exterior. The sauce was rich and tangy, with a hint of sweetness that balanced out the dish perfectly.My dining companion opted for the seafood risotto, which was loaded with succulent shrimp, scallops, and mussels. The risotto was creamy and perfectly cooked, with a subtle hint of saffron that added depth and complexity to the dish.We also shared a side of roasted Brussels sprouts, which were tender and flavorful, with a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness. The prices were reasonable, with most dishes falling in the $15-$25 range.Overall, our dining experience at Lidia's Pittsburgh was exceptional. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, the service was top-notch, and the food was delicious and authentic. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a taste of Italy in the 'Burgh.",

The egg rolls were not as crispy as usual, and the lo mein was a bit overcooked.I've also noticed that the portions have been getting smaller over time.

I always get the hot and sour soup, and it's always flavorful and satisfying.The atmosphere is also nice. The decor is traditional Chinese and the lighting is dim, which creates a cozy atmosphere.The prices are reasonable, too.

It's a reliable choice for good Chinese food.The wait staff is also friendly and attentive.

You'll find a large warehouse-style store with a wide selection of bulk items, groceries, and electronics. The prices are generally competitive with other warehouse clubs, and they often have sales and promotions.One difference I've noticed between BJ's and Sam's Club is the layout of the store. BJ's seems to have a more organized and easier-to-navigate layout, with clear signs and a logical flow to the aisles. Sam's Club, on the other hand, can feel a bit more cluttered and overwhelming.Another advantage of BJ's is their membership benefits. They offer a variety of membership levels, including a basic membership for individuals and families, as well as a business membership for small business owners. These memberships come with perks like discounts on certain items, free shipping on online orders, and special promotions.One thing to keep in mind when shopping at BJ's is that they have a minimum purchase requirement for some items. This can be a bit frustrating if you're only looking to buy a few things, but it's worth it if you're planning to buy in bulk.Overall, I'd recommend BJ's to anyone looking for a convenient and cost-effective way to buy bulk items and groceries.
