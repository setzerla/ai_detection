The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled. nnNow lets get to the nitty gritty: the food. nnI got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it. nnMy girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. nnI recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city. nnOh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world.",

I was initially told the delivery would arrive in 45 minutes to an hour, but the food came knocking on my hotel room sooner than expected. nnThe complimentary mini garlic buns were cooled by that time. It was over-buttered but yummy nonetheless. It was a delight to see the whopping serving of pasta after not having anything to eat all day. Thankfully it was kept warm by the plastic container and comforting with every bite. The generous servings of angel hair was filled to the brim with juicy chicken slices, very few shrimps, mushrooms, roasted and hot peppers drenched in a mild marinara sauce. The flood of sweet and semi-savory marinara was not the ideal and the peppers also did not make an impression. The quality of the pasta was overcooked and oversoaked, but the pieces of chunky chicken were tender and delicious. The side salad did not look very fresh and was not newsworthy. nnI didn't get a chance to visit the venue to get a better impression of the establishment, but as a delivery service I thought it was fast while portions were very generous. Value wise, kudos to them for having a $5 children's menu for those at the ages 2-10. For my dish however, I still consider it overpriced for what was supposed to be their fanciest pasta dish. 2. 5 stars for the experience.",

It's not huge like the Smithsonian, but it's certainly cool seeing real dinosaur bones.

I prefer my museums in chronological order, not cool to less cool, which is what this seems to be.

I have never had a wait staff say \"thank you\" and \"you're welcome\" more than this. They even joked with me as I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my delayed guest.

I guess it would be OK if you like your chicken parm buried in veggies and cheese. Me? I like my chicken parmesan to be mostly, you know, chicken. It wasn't bad, mind you, but I can make a better dish at home and I am certainly not an Italian restaurant. Can't say I recommend the meal I had here this day. (on the other hand, I did once have the lasagna here and I remember it being tasty). nnQuite frankly, for me the Olive Garden is a better Italian experience, even with all of its chain restaurant failings.

First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait.. . and wait.. . and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills.. . yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later.. . that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion.. .

We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same. nWe started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day! nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \"fishy\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level. nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah.

The store manager/owner kindly refunded the purchase, which was nice, but I would still never buy anything. Also, compared to Lotus Food Co, some of the items in this store are more expensive.

The 1st time I had a burger which tasted funny and I didn't finish it. I got food poisoning and was so sick. This I thought might have been a stomach flu so I did try this place again. The 2nd time I was with some friends from the neighborhood and 3/5 of us had the spaghetti and meatballs and we got food poisoning. Now I'm thinking that they have a hygiene problem with the ground meat. I was going to stay away from the place but a friend from Troy hill liked to stop there because it was close to her home. No problem, next time I got french fries with gravy. How could this be a problem?. When they got to the table they had put cold canned gravy on my fries. When I told the waitress about it she took it back to the kitchen and microwaved it till it was the heat of lava. Needless to say I refused to pay for them. The 4th time my friend dragged me there, I had a salad. I didn't get sick but it wasn't anything special with bagged salad mix and a couple of under ripe tomato pieces and cucumber. The last time I only got a slice of pie and this was good. I no longer have to go to Billy's, my dear friend has passed away and I refuse to go anywhere near the place. To the owner-Please sell the restaurant, you obviously don't care for the place or know how to handle food safely.",

There weren't any signs or notes anywhere about happy hour specials, so I asked our bartender. I cannot remember everything that she stated, but I zoned in when she mentioned $2 off Martinis. I chose the cucumber basil martini and my friend did the same. Too strong for me- even with the basil infused vodka and fresh cucumber, my friend on the other hand found it light and refreshing. nnWe weren't that hungry so we decided to split an appetizer and order salads. We split the chicken quesadilla appetizer and both ordered house salads. I modified my house salad to have feta rather than blue cheese and chose the strawberry vinaigrette as my dressing. nnThe quesadillas were good, as far as chicken quesadillas go. The guacamole it was served with was awesome, although they didn't supply us with enough salsa, sour cream or guacamole for all four quesadillas. Or maybe I am just too obsessed with condiments, haha. nnThe salad was yummy, I loved the vinaigrette! It was a decent portion as well. nnAlthough I enjoyed the experience, I do not think I will be returning. Two drinks, two salads and one appetizer cost is $50. The Martinis alone, even with their happy hour deal, were still $8 each. I don't mind spending $50 on a meal, but for how average everything was, that was entirely too much. nnMaybe I will return for a drink or two one day.",

It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for. nnI don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime. It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. nnFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside.

Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible.

Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. nGone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement. nI just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America.",

Plus the Pirates were playing at 4: 05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game. nnWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table. Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful. Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers. We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest. \" In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell). I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer. I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking. So the $6. 95 10 beer sampler was well worth it. nnDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls. They were okay, but not quite what I expected. The spicy ranch was top notch, though. As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger. They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium). And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win! nnMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler. The glass container itself is sold for $12. 95. That's the empty price. To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5. Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me. So I walked out empty handed. But it won't deter me from returning.",

Being that it is a pharmacy, there wouldn't be a back door or windows, so the lot has a feeling of dangerous seclusion. nnInside the store, everything I saw told me that \"this is a pharmacy that is in a rough neighborhood\": shelves are only about 4'6\" tall (presumably so workers can see what people are doing in the aisles); bizarre things are locked in cabinets with clear covers (regular brands of shampoo?! ); beauty items regularly updated, weren't (I, er, have a nail polish problem; some of the products were about 4 seasons behind and quite a few polishes were separated); it feels like there isn't enough room for the products, which are disorganized and crammed onto shelves (reference the odd shelf height limitation). nnIf you can spare the gas and time, there is another a CVS on Center Ave within a mile or so or a Walgreen's (Penn Circ S+Trade St. ) and a Rite Aid (Baum+Negley) within 1/2 mile.",

I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food. nnThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls. nnSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great.

Well the menu is a bit pricey and I don't mind paying for good food so I had high expectations. He bison burger was mediocre (took a star away) The menu said bacon, but none showed up. No worries probably better for me. I felt at $15 for a bison burger this thing should freaking be awesome. Not the case. I would put it at $8. 99-$9. 99 price range I would pay since they gave me chips as a side. So they lost another star for over priced for the value I received. The girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu. Two basic rolls and miso soup for $16. This would easy go for $14 at other places during lunch. So ultimately would I give it another shot? Yes, but only if it is convenient. I would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place. nnHelpful advice for the OFM.

I had the pork dinner (not sure if that's how it's listed on the menu) which included their pork shoulder and ribs along with 2 sides (I had the corn and beans). It was A LOT of food. Next time I'll stick to either just ribs or just a pork sandwich. My husband had ribs and beef brisquet. He couldn't stop raving. The restaurant is small and was full when we showed up shortly before closing time. A table opened up quickly though. They started mopping up as we were eating (which the staff had graciously \"warned\" us about) but it didn't take away from the delicious food. Hopefully it doesn't take as long as at did for my first visit to get there a second time.",

The Cross Plains State Bank (located just down the road from here) has recently closed, and I was in need of cash prior to my hair cut. I figured Walgreens would have an ATM, or at the very least, would provide cash back with a purchase. nn- ATM (from BMO Harris) is about 91 years old, charges a $3 fee, and is slower than molasses. Worse yet, after staring at the screen as it read \"Transaction Processing\" for 6-minutes, the ATM failed to work. It spit out a receipt that said, \"Transaction Failed. \" Be warned - the service fee is an unreasonable $3; however, since I doubt this thing ever works, you won't pay the fee (you also won't get any cash). nn- Prices are outrageous. With the ATM down, I made my way to the soda area so that I could buy a Diet Coke and then get cash back from the register. Their soda prices are a good $0. 30 higher than anyone else. I shouldn't be surprised, nor should I be complaining about this, as it's no secret that Walgreens generally charges a premium for anything in their store. nn- Checkouts are slow. I got into line to check-out with my Diet Coke. I was 7th in line. One cashier. After 5 people were checked out (only one more person in front of me), the cashier fires-up the microphone and asks for more checkout assistance. Ugh. nn- When I went to check out and hit the \"cash back\" option, the kid who was running the newly opened register informed me that he didn't have $20 in his drawer to give me for change. Really? He had to get a $20 from the other checker. nn- You can't enter/exit from University; you have to enter from Branch Streetnn+ At least it's bright in here and the store feels fairly clean.",

That makes it a little difficult to classify, but I'll do my best. nnFirst, you have a largish bar area. This section alone is larger than many sports bars these days, and it looks even larger because it's open, rather than being cramped and confined. While there did not seem to be any smokiness to the area, there could have been some. It was definitely loud, as most any bar will be on this sort of night. nnNext, you have a dining section, which wouldn't be much different than any other family-style dining area, except for the fact that it was right next to the bar. So if you take the family, you'll want to be aware of this. It's not exactly set up for a quiet night out, even on the calmest of times, and this certainly wasn't that. nnThe good news for older crowds (those without younger kids) is that if you're waiting for a table, you can wait in the bar section. They also have these very long tables that run the length of the bar area, and you can even eat there if you don't mind the crowd. We didn't really feel like waiting, and since the whole building had a sort of bar feel to it, felt like it really didn't matter. nnIn the end, it didn't. The only problem with this was getting the attention of a waitress. Once we did, service went along fairly well, though getting refills was a bit slow. nnThe food was good, and priced decently, but appetizers were expensive, as can be expected in most bars. Wings especially were not cheap. But it was all tasty. I don't know that we'll be back, but it's certainly better than most bars, and definitely a leg up on most sports bars.",

Pizza Hut pies, to be sure, but they are the real ones, not the baby-sized ones. That can actually be both good and bad. nnIt's good because you can get a decent slice from the buffet. It can be bad because with room for only four pizzas at a time, and with one of those at any given time being a dessert pizza, it means if one of the three main pizzas isn't one that you like, you may have to wait for one that you like. This is an issue because the restaurant isn't very busy - probably the reason for the banner outside. As such, the three pizzas don't go very fast. nnStill, if you're at Pizza Hut, chances are that you like their pizza at least okay. It's not like you're out on a limb to try something adventurous. If you want more variety, go to CiCi's Pizza. If you want something good, try Big Guy's Pizza instead. nnAnyway, the pizza isn't bad. You just don't get a lot of choices. They also have pasta, but in my experience, it's usually almost gone. I don't know if this is because people don't like the choices of pizza and eat all the pasta, because they don't put much out, or some combination of both. There are also bread sticks, but they don't usually have many of those either. There is a good bit of marinara sauce, but I'm not sure what you're supposed to use it on, since the pizza has plenty and there is usually little pasta or bread. You can also get a salad, but it costs extra. nnThe service is generally friendly, but not very good. The price is a bit much. For all this and a drink you'll pay more than you should.

The breakfast \"buffet\" was no more that a glorified lets-throw-some-typical-mediocre-breakfast-items on a couple of tables and call it  Breakfast Buffet. I went expecting rather a brunch - i.e. : breakfast AND lunch items - after all, they weren't even open until 11 and I'm not much of a breakfast food-type eater anyway. For the price they charged the following was served: fruit (nothing special- cantaloupe, strawberries and honeydew), your typical institutional scrambled eggs - rather plain, bacon, sausage links & patties, biscuits and gravy- thin gravy, short on any sausage mixed in, frenchtoast sticks - which were hard as rocks already and they had only been open 20 minutes! It took a while, and I do mean a WHILE for our server to even show up to begin with and she didn't come back to check on us very often. I had to ASK about the Bloody Mary Bar to which she replied - \"oh yeah it's in the back there\" - this server was NOT really hawking the attributes of the restaurant like one would expect - even when we mentioned it was our first time for the Breakfast buffet. It's an eclectic place, and the food is typically good for the most part - but the same old thing menu. Ribs are good and as I mentioned earlier the prime rib is excellent.. . but that's probably all we will get there from now on, if we return at all.

This location is not an overwhelmingly huge store like some of the big chain pet stores I've been to, and yet they manage to cram more variety of foods, toys, and supplies than any other store I've been to. I'm trying to switch my cats to a grain-free diet, and while the cats are resisting, Mounds has offered me lots of options! So wonderful. nnI'm not actually familiar with Mounds as a company, but from the tiny bit of research I've done--and the newsletter they gave me--it looks like they are really working to make a difference in the Madison/Southern Wisconsin area. And for that, they at least deserve thumbs up. nnThat said, this location is a bit hard to navigate. I had to wander through the dog food to find the cat food, and the toys were in a totally random spot. Once I found them, though, I was fine. I think the store could use a bit more lighting or something to make it feel a little less dungeon-like, but it's not like you're running around in the dark or anything, either. nnAs for service, I'm really split. This is where the half-star comes in. While the cashiers have always been friendly while I check out, and the first time I was there I had someone ask if I needed help finding anything (which was the time I didn't, as I was legitimately just wandering around), I've not had any additional offers of help, and the employees I see around the store seem a bit stand-offish. That said, it could just be I was there on a few bad days, as the cashiers were super friendly, so it's not horrible customer service, either.",

I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave. I was floored. It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early. nnThe kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent. Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front. (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab. ) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service. nnIn short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.

They don't even tell you that your waitress might be able to get you that item from the kitchen. nn3) One of the hostesses has a real attitude on her and can barely contain her contempt for the customers. I asked her specifically to find my waitress at one point and she never did. I had to get up and find my waitress myself. nnAll in all this is a very poorly run establishment, which I blame on management for not having enough wait staff onsite during the busy hours, and also for not making sure that the hostesses and buffet workers communicate politely and effectively to the customers.

I said attempt because they didn't have much to offer. Every time we made a selection it was either 86 or a component was 86. The explaination we were given was it was very busy Friday night and ran out of stuff - hello it is now Sunday afternoon. You are advertising watching the games at your location. I pointed out that there is a grocery store within walking distance. The reply was the owners won't let us buy anything. I ordered shepards pie which is supposed to be a meat potato and veggie dish. When it showed up at the table it had at least 1/2inch of melted cheese on top a fact not mentioned in the description. After scraping that off I proceeded to dig in. Unfortunately the dish was made with less than an ounce of meat alittle bit of peas and corn and a pile of potatoes. I had the honor of paying $10 for that. 2) OK everyone can have a bad day so we returned this Sunday. Once again they were out of things but not as bad as last week. I ordered a specialty burger for $11 Safe right? Wrong. It came out as any basic burger would except for the fact that the actual patty looked liked someone took a bite out of it.

I called back 7/26 and was told by Chris that he would reach out to the tech to see why he never showed up and that someone would call me to update me. Still nothing. I called back this morning and was told that since it was the weekend the tech isn't working, which is completely different than what Chris told me the day prior, and that he felt like someone would definitely be here tomorrow, Monday. nnI'm understanding that things happen, but it seems like they would be willing at least to give us a call and keep us in the loop as to why it has now been 12 whole days since my first service call and they can't get someone out here. nnIf I had to recommend any music service at all for your business it would definitely not be this one.",

I brought my work shirts in and handed them to the woman to look at to give me a direct price. She looked at my shirts. I also had one apron, a sun dress and to 2 pair of jeans to be repaired. The first woman i delt with told me one price but when I came in to pick up my order. My shirtsand aprons still had the stains on them. I could have done a better job with some oxy clean, Reason i didnt was bc i didnt want to have to go through that. So now the woman tells me double the price then what the first woman said to me and didnt want to help me on there mistake! Then the jeans for repair she tells me it would cost me at most 7 dollars a pair of pants to get repaired! The other woman tell me i owe 16 dollars a pair! DOUBLE THEN WHAT I WAS TOLD! She said they needed to be cleaned? so you just add on services because its what you think and just charge them for the service! I was charged double for every piece of clothing. I asked for a manger it was the of course her! so i wanted to speak to someone else higher and she refused to give me any kind of contact with them? needless to say i had to pay way more then what i was told and when i was in there she kept pushing me aside to help other customers when I was there first and a PAYING customer too! Totally Unprofessional the way this biss is run! GO ELSEWHERE TRYING TO SAVE YOU FROM A NIGHTMARE AT THE DRY CLEANERS!! !",

Lets just say I held my toungue when asked how I liked my meal at the end of the day. nnThe Service: n- A little slow honestly, it took them forever to get my beer (not cool bro) and even longer to come get my order. Friendly people as per the usual, but for some reason they are on asian standard time when it comes to serving you. nnThe Food: n- Standard hibachi food, solid but nothing special. A big plus for me are the portions. They tend to give you larger portions than other restaurants along with the traditional soup, salad, shrimp, and veggies. In fact, this is the only place I've seen that gives you noodles with your dish at no extra cost. Well played Nakato. nnThe Ambiancen- Gotta love the ambiance.

I am thoroughly disappointed because this is a steakhouse - paying $25 for 18oz ($18. 80/lbs) should guarantee you get a great steak, or at the very last a fair quality steak. My wife had the prime rib, she enjoyed it despite the overabundance of pepper. She puts A1 sauce on steak, and being a steak snob I don't weight her opinions as heavily. I really wanted to like this steak but now I just really want my money back (along with my time and a chance to do this all over again somewhere else). The Outlaw Ribeye should be outlawed if they keep serving  up so much sinew. The sinew so dominated my review that the lack of marbling (flecks of fat) and abundance of large globs of fat (large gobs don't count as marbling) were secondary. I am able to chew and eat fat with some meat, but I had to spit out so many bites of steak because I couldn't even chew them. These sinews got stuck in my teeth like floss and I could pull them out because they were so long.",

The soup had a nice chicken broth but the tofu was lacking, just a couple slivers. The vegetables in the soup were a frozen medley* variety with the processed baby carrots, snow peas, and cauliflower. The pork dumplings were certainly made in house and quite good. The gai lan with oyster sauce was actually shanghi tips (baby bok choy) with a thin brown sauce that was quite light in flavor and a sprinkling of jarred minced garlic ontop, not what we ordered (or on the menu as we could tell). The eggplant in garlic sauce came to the table as eggplant with a szechuan style sweet and sour sauce. The fish came to the table as a steamed fillet on a plate with the same frozen vegetable* ontop except the medley was peppers, onions, carrot, broccoli. The sauce was not radically different than the sauce accompanying the shanghi tips with the addition of a sprinkling of fermented black beans in lieu of the garlic.

I walked over to the station at the base of the stairs and asked if we needed to wait or if we could just sit at the empty table and was told to go ahead and take a seat. nnFast forward a couple of minutes and an employee approaches the table to ask us why we're sitting there. I explained that I was told it was okay, and after a short conversation with the person who told me we could sit there, the employee went about his business. We were given chips and salsa (chips were slightly stale and had no salt on them at all; salsa was AMAZING but served in horribly inconvenient bowls that caused a mess every time you dipped into them) and ordered beers and waters. The beers arrived quickly, but we had to ask not one but TWO more times before we finally got our water. nnFood-wise, I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas, which were extremely bland. My friend enjoyed his Pollo Borracho, mostly because of the sauce, but overall the food wasn't impressive. Getting our waitress to come back to our table to refill anything (salsa, chips, drinks) or to bring us our check was next to impossible. Honestly the only reason I'm giving Zapata's two stars instead of just one is because I know they were busy (and obviously that affects the quality of service) and because my friend enjoyed his meal, though I didn't like mine. That said, if I was to end up back in this area, I doubt I'd return to this restaurant.",

I looked around at the sea of red and asked him what his current demographic/ customer base thought of missing the second half of the game. He again referenced the cost.

After each of us took our first bite, we all lookedvat each other with the sort of face you make when you are wondering what was that. The look was followed by universal disdain for this so called meal. The chicken was inedible, the sauce was nothing resembling tomato sauce found on 99% of all Italian meals. We should have been tipped off when the chicken was grilled not breaded as is the case with this dish. BLAND. GROSS. TERRIBLE. Now comes the part that totally caused me to write this. We sent it all back. We were asked \"would you like something else? \". Not a chance. If this was the indicator for the so called cuisine we wanted nothing to do with it. The \"manager\" came to our table. \"You have to pay for the entire meal\". Seriously? Seriously! Now again in 99% of the time when food is returned, the normal proper way of doing business is to say \"sorry you didn't like your food. We will deduct the cost from your bill\". LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. In the face of protecting my family from the embarassment of the police being called, I paid $83 for this CRAP. $83!! ! As I left I suggested the manager change this policy. It was met with a smirk and defiance. In the face of my saying the social media world will hear about this, she couldn't care less. So, here it is.

I knew that he liked it because all of a sudden, he wasn't talking to me, he wasn't looking at me, he was just eating. nnWe both put down our forks when we were full, but kept taking bites here & there as we waited for boxes. nnThe service was a little slow after we got our food, but it didn't seem like neglect, it was busy & there just seems to be a small number of staff. But, they were super friendly & engaging, & this first visit will not be our last. I'm interested in trying the buffet to get a broader taste of their fine food!",

Yes, they do have an olive bar and they often have produce you wont find at Wal-Mart or County Market, however, this selection is really not that great. If you have a specific need, I suggest calling around to Sunsinger, World Harvest, the Co-op, Art-Mart, or even Urbana Meijer before checking this Schnucks. Their cheese selection is no better than County Market. nnOne thing I give them props for is their sushi. It is still crappy grocery store sushi, but for grocery store sushi it is as good as it gets. I suggest getting it around noon, and forget about the brown rice sushi- its terrible. nnThe prices are consistently higher here than County Market, Meijer, and Wal-Mart and IGA. The comparison to Dominicks of Chicago is apt in this regard, however I think that this store is not quite that high-end in overall quality. I peg Schnucks' around the neighborhood of most Jewel stores. nnLiquor/beer/wine selection is darn good for a grocery store, but they have a ridiculous booze policy: they card everybody you are with, so if somebody accompanying you doesn't bring their ID with them, they wont sell you alcohol.

But they would probably mace me if I tried to run up and give them a hug. nnThey have a fabric department, which seems to be a feature that the newer, super walmarts are missing. Unfortunately, the store is usually running a skeleton crew most of the time, so it's hard to find an employee in that section of the store who knows how to cut some fabric. nnMost of the employees here are like most of the employees at any Walmart, underpaid, and overworked. So it doesn't bother me too much when they frown at me. I've been on the other side of the register before, so I know how soul crushing it can be. Though, they may not be frowning at me because of that reason, they probably just know I'm an incredible dufus. nnHowever, there is one employee there who is usually cashiering, and has this wonderful Russian accent. She's also very friendly and cheery. The other day she was telling me about growing her own basil, freezing it in ice cube trays with chicken stock, and then plopping the cubes in rice later on for flavoring. Tricky, tricky! nnAnyway, I guess I am more impressed by the larger Walmart in Monona that has the shopping cart escalators. I could stand there all day and launch carts down that thing, it really revs up the dork in me. nnBut in the meantime, if I don't feel like heading over that way I could just stop at this Walmart to get maced by the grannies and listen to cooking recipes from Nina.",

The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, \"It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it. \". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield.

You can relive getting lectured by your parents as they talk about the finer points of proper brushing from your vulnerable position strapped in a chair. Few survive getting a filling but it is rumored that the experience is as pleasant as hearing fingernails on a chalkboard. They are very talented in manhandling delicate gum tissue and patients are guaranteed a sore mouth for the rest of the day. Customer service is second to none. The office has evening appointments and if you are fortunate to schedule one you will be offered a once in a life time opportunity to come in earlier. However if you are not able to get off of work and have to decline coming in early do not be surprised to get a call back from the receptionist informing you that your evening appointment is canceled because something unexpected has come up. They like to provide service the old fashioned way so do not expect any state of the art technology. Yes this place is highly recommended  for those looking for crap dentistry.",

God. nnOne would think that any restaurant in America's Dairyland, especially a chain restaurant that has been around for decades, could serve breakfast without screwing it up. nnOur family of three ordered breakfast for dinner tonight and this Perkins disappointed the heck out of us. nnOne order was steak and eggs: the steak was supposed to be medium and the eggs over hard. What came to the table was a bloody, raw steak -- not rare, mind you, but raw -- and eggs with a translucent, inedible crust around the outer edge. nnSome of that crust ended up in one of the other orders, which was scrambled eggs with biscuits and gravy. One does not expect the possibility of breaking a tooth when eating scrambled eggs, but not one, not two, but three two-inch long pieces of that translucent crust ended up in the folded, dry \"scrambled eggs. \"nnAnother order of scrambled eggs -- mine -- had a long, thin, hair-like thread of indeterminate origin. Was it the same substance as the translucent crust? Was it a string from a hairnet? Was it a human hair? When I pulled it from my mouth, it split in two and curled up like elastic might curl up. nnOur server was appropriately apologetic and tried to make things okay -- the service was good, but the food was absolutely horrid! nnThe manager asked us how our dinner was when we went to pay, so we told her. She took 20% off of our bill but, truly, the food we ate was overpriced at any discount. If we all hadn't been so darn hungry and tired, we'd have left without eating. And if I had it to do over, I would have insisted we all leave after finding the inedible translucent hard gluey stuff in the eggs and find somewhere else to go. nnDo NOT repeat our mistake. AVOID this restaurant. Try the IHOP down the road if you want breakfast. Go across the interstate to Texas Roadhouse if you want a steak. Go hungry if you must, just don't eat here. Please.",

I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise. Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option. We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them. nnFood:  It's typical bar food. They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley. Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong. nnService:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter. There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there. Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \"I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes\" etc, etc. These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along. It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that. The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude. nnPersonally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out.",

I tried two different dishes from the more expensive menu, some beef which was edible but undermediocre, and then a whole \"Szechuan bean chili whole fish\" dish which was so bad and literally stinky I couldn't finish it. (I should mention I love Chinese food and I had lots of it, in lots of places. ) The reason I still visit the place, rarely, is a cheapish and tasty Crispy Whole Fish, in the regular menu, which is not authentic Chinese, but which for some reason I crave every three months. nnThe campus Chinese place to go is Lai-Lai, period. There's simply no comparison in quality, and when the ratio price/quantity/quality satisfaction is being taken into account, Lai-Lai offers by far the best deal on campus.

Four hours later, I found a maintenance worker myself who immediately came to the room and replaced the lamp. There is no fan in the bathroom, but that's not much of an issue because there isn't much steam since the water only gets lukewarm at best. On 4-21-14, at 3: 44am I was unpleasantly shocked awake by a very loud alarm somewhere in the hall outside my room. I later found out that it was thought to be due to a dirty smoke detector. That increased my confidence in the overall cleanliness of the facility. On 4-22-14, I was appalled that a housekeeper walked into the room without even knocking. That was very frightening to hear a key card clicking in my door when I didn't have any guests! There are six pieces of fruit put out on the front desk each morning. If you don't get one of those, you'll have to pay ten dollars for a mediocre breakfast bar. nnThis part deserves it's own paragraph. The smell of this facility is that of an angry, unbathed gladiator suffering the heat of a Roman sun mixed with the excretions of baby post-sweet potato. You've been warned. The air handling is so terrible, I truly cannot warn you enough. I am not able to hold my breath long enough to tolerate the stench. Particularly worrisome is that the stink is worst in a stairwell. If the dirty smoke detectors ever went of with warning of impending doom, that doom may be more so from the stairwell stink (remember not to play in elevators during a fire! ) than the fire. nnThe pool is nice!",

I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. nnHowever, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. nnI pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. nnLesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs. nn**** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then.

Also, I have found that in the larger clinics, like Matthews, you and your pet often get lost in the crowd.

In a small clinic with one or 2 vets and fewer techs, they actually KNOW your pet and are more likely to pick up on problems.

The only one I can ever remember is the Friday Fish and Chips because it's always the special I want and it's never Friday when I'm there! nnI mostly land on the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp. The greens are always fresh and the shrimp are plump, firm and seasoned/grilled well. Monday's Caesar dressing was just a wee bit flat but that was the first time ever so, forgiven. Also opted for the Tomato Bisque yesterday. It was quite good. Nice balanced flavors, hot, creamy, delicious! When I have strayed to a burger or something else more substantial, I always walk away satisfied as well although, it's not a cheap lunch by any stretch. nnNot sure I will ever give them a chance to up the 3 Star dinner lens with which I view them. Too many other, more consistent, options in the price range and vicinity.",

This girl is getting excited about salad? \" Yes, yes I am.

It looks like a house which is converted to a beautiful restaurant. There is valet parking available. The receptionist at the front gave us a nice seat on the second floor. It was just our luck because there was live jazz music being played that night. During the restaurant week, this place does have a very good choice of Entrees. You will be served with a 3 course meal with the addition of a glass wine of your choice. We had the cup of seafood gumbo to begin with. The soup served was the right quantity. Not too much or too less. Soup was warm enough. The contained scallops, shrimp, vegetables. For the entree, we had Diane with Chicken and Fresh Fish (blackened Tilapia). Both the chicken as well as fish we cooked well. The topping on the fresh fish were great. The diane chicken had a variety of vegetables on it along with rice. You can also have shrimp and chicken together in it. The food was warm. The third and final course is a dessert of your choice. We chose to have the Key Lime Pie. I cant remember much but I don't think a Key Lime Pie can go wrong at all. The server was definitely very polite and nice to us. She was checking on us at regular intervals and the food was served in a timely manner. During restaurant week, I would say the price of the meal is $$.

The park is reasonably clean, yet it still stinks (see the negative below). The park also caters well to children with the Nickelodeon theme park (I am 15 and still enjoy the Nick Coasters) and good music. nnThe negative is that it's employees aren't very accommodating, and it's almost always over-crowded, smelly, and expensive. The employees at rides are usually not interested in taking care of your bags or saying hello and seem to not enjoy their jobs at all. Pretty much every ride will require a average of a 20 minute wait-on a good day.. . I guess not bad if you compare to Disney World. Carowinds also has a permanent smell of hot fast food decaying on the pavement and it's pretty much impossible to escape. it is also pretty expensive-not only the ticket in, but at the gift shops and the various games (the games require extra money to play, usually 5-15$). nnAll in all, Carowinds is a decent theme park with great roller coasters and bearable surroundings. If you spend the whole day there and enjoy the roller coasters, you are probably getting your money's worth and will probably have a good experience.",

The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. nnThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service.",

You've seen this place a million times in hundreds of cities around the nation. The same shitty decor, the same shitty Budweiser and Corona ads plastered tackily all over the wall. The mass-produced, made-in-china imitation \"papel picado\" and the cheap dining tables and chairs. You have definitely been here before. Sometimes I wonder if the same guy bought all the restaurants in the US and recycled the theme and look and simply changed the  name to keep up a false sense of diversity. nnWent with Mother Dearest for lunch today and had a very unremarkable experience. Service was good and fast, food was very nice and tasted as decent as any other of these types of restaurants. nnThe only thing worth mentioning, and it's not really a good thing, is that with your chips and salsa they also give you a little dish of a white dip. I couldn't place it exactly but it kinda tasted like ranch and bacon. It was very artificial tasting too.. . maybe from a powder and cream cheese? Who knows? It wasn't horrible, but it just did't mesh well with the other stuff. nnAlso, for what it is, generic Mexican-themed food, it's kinda pricey. You really won't find a decent dish for under $8 on the menu after 3pm. Just thought I'd throw it out there. nnAll in all, going here is like going to McDonald's for a burger.

It's a comfortable sitting arrangement. nnSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before. The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi. nnPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation. It was a very simple dish put together. nnSake - they are pricey. $15. 00 minimum. nnRamen - the soup was very tasty. nnOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted.

So don't just drive by thinking it's too crowded. nnThe staff are great. With a restaurant being that busy it would be easy to get flustered, but I've never had bad service. The guy in charge of the waiting list is great at his job (don't remember his name). He keeps the revolving door of people working like a well oiled machine. The wait staff are also good. I've never had a bad waiter/waitress. Very polite and helpful if you need anything. The kitchen must be crazy with all the orders, but the food is always good and comes out fast. nnI take all of my out of town guests here and they have all fallen in love with this place.",

For a gym as busy as Dowd, I would expect the yoga studio to be larger, or for there to be more than one studio. I've learned to come early in order to guarantee a space on the floor. In addition, although the classes I've attended have been high impact, they've been low atmo - lights ablazing, music non-existent, less emphasis on form than WorkOut.

I'm a Canon guy and have always been able to find what I'm in the market for. I most recently found a lens hood for my 50mm 1. 4 that was pretty hard to track down even on the internet. Also, recently sold an old Pentax K1000 and some old darkroom gear here. For the shape that some of it was in, I got a pretty good deal. nnWhere I think Biggs has some serious shortcomings is their customer service. Here's the deal, if you're not a professional photographer, (I personally am not. Just a hobby I've had for years) then you don't need to be condescending. I've had a few instances where a few of the staff members seemed to act a little more than inconvenienced to work with me.

I have no idea how no one has fallen out riding this - the seating design is revolutionary and freeing and allows completely uninhibited body movement from the waste up. It is the only coaster my husband felt terrified of while riding and he begged to skip this one a second time around. I, for one, felt very secure for some reason and loved the height and speed. It was a serious thrill. nnA first for me was the backwards coaster, Cobra. I'd never experienced this kind of design and it was such a blast. The first drop going forward is amazing, and then you reach the midway point and reverse going backward while going upside down multiple times. It was scary, exciting, and unique. nnI really liked how the park was designed - no space was wasted. You do not have to walk a quarter mile between fun things to do. The park is huge and hosts a surprising amount of roller coasters, but we did not feel exhausted walking the park itself all day. It was incredibly easy to navigate. Additionally, there were so many cool kid's exhibits and rides that were a big step up from most amusement parks I'm accustomed to. nnMy only real gripe is with some of the workers. We spoke with a handful that were just really, really weird. Not creepy.. . Just a bit off. There was a lot of over sharing involved. The guy that did our caricature portrait also flat out sucked! The drawing was AWFUL! It was disappointed and not creative at all. Kind of middle school grade. nnThis is a great park and absolutely a must do if you are in the Charlotte area.

Four slices of tenderloin and a small chunk of shoulder, served atop a bed of spinach, which in turn was on top of some sort of risotto (rice-like) mixture, and the whole shebang was highlighted with berries (huckleberries, I think). nnThe tenderloin was average. Good, but a smallish portion, and nothing really special about it. The shoulder was excellent, and rivaled a tender pot roast. The risotto was good, as was the berry that highlighted the plate. The spinach just looked nasty (and I _like_ spinach), so I didn't try it. nnBeverage service was excellent. Rarely did I drink more than a bit from my water glass before it was refilled to the top. Same with my ginger ale. Bar service appeared to be pretty speedy as well. But food service was horrid. Slow, slow, slow. nnSeveral of the people in our party ordered a chocolate cake dessert at the time they ordered dinner - apparently it takes a while to prepare. Well, our server didn't really seem to notice that other people at the table might want some dessert, and was almost shocked when two of us asked for dessert menus when the cakes started arriving. nnAn order of ice cream and another of berries went completely unserved, though we waited twenty minutes or so for them. I understand if one of the little cakes was ordered, it might take a while to cook. But how long does it take to scoop some ice cream and throw some berries on a plate? nnI doubt we'll be back, but it isn't completely about the service.

We will never return to this establishment for a meal again. nnOur waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date. nnThe main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me. We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience.",

You have to go outside and follow the signs. n- B and E checkpoints have TSA Precheck lines. Other checkpoints have \"elite\" security queues which are not specific to just US Airways.

First of all, LACK OF selections, maybe this is an American thing to want to have a couple more options, but to be fair, you can see the menu that is listed under the photos section here, you get like 3 choices. I got the vegetarian platter as well, maybe that's why it's not very good. But I always prefer vegetarian and I've had MUCH MUCH better food elsewhere. I got some kidney beans mixed in with my rice.. . I feel like I could have cooked myself this with a can of beans dumped into my rice? On top of the kidney beans the veggie platter also comes with string beans.. . ok they are the best on the my plate. And then it was another selection of veggie that I am not quite sure what it is but this place kinda just reminds me of badly cooked southern food to be honest. But hey, I am going to go back and maybe give it another try on the meat product. As far as veggies goes, not tasty is for sure.",

The food was so-so. My son had a hamburger which was delicious - my chicken bruschetta was fair but cold and the broccoli had no butter, seasoning, nothing. It was over priced for what the meal consisted of. I gave two stars because  I was disappointed mainly with the service more so than the food.

The only disturbing thing about it was the noise level. There's no wall between the cozy dimly lit dining room and the loud blaring kitchen. I understand (and enjoy! ) the concept of \"open kitchen\" dining, but I think that should be reserved for different types of restaurants. The open kitchen didn't feel right for an upscale seafood restaurant that can/should be used for special occasions and dates. nnAnyway, we had fantastic service. Just be prepared to enjoy an hour and a half relaxing meal. To start, we tried the bento box appetizer, which was a combination of different things (sashimi, sushi, beef, eggroll), but I think next time I would go with just a couple of sushi rolls. We also splurged and added the flash-fried calamari as it sounded so good when our server was describing it to us. And she was right. It was very tasty and not at all chewy. It also didn't include the baby squids with attached tentacles that you might normally find in calamari dishes. The only disappointing thing was the portion size. Good thing we got the bento box, too! nnI ordered the sea scallops for my entree and chose the Japanese ponzu sauce (there are 5 choices! ) to go with it. The three tennis ball-sized scallops had a LOT of flavor to them and the fingerling potatoes on the side were tasty, too. Again, though, the portion was pretty small, but with all things added up, we were full by the end of our meal. nnAll in all, we had a very enjoyable experience, but I can't say that when thinking of places to go in the future, I'd return anytime soon. There are so many other options out there and Upstream didn't \"wow\" us enough to return time and time again.",

It might be important to note I'd had a huge curry craving for months. Maharani, while it definitely hit the spot, was lacking in a few areas. nnI called in the order and then went to pick it up. It was very straightforward and simple. They had the food ready exactly when they said they would. The servers and cashier were very friendly and courteous. nnI tried the plain naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and mutter paneer. I even found some papadum and mint sauce wrapped up in my bag, which was nice. For some reason, having the papadum feels nice and familiar. The naan was alright, but not as fluffy as I had hoped. It was crispier in a lot of places, and I think it just needs to be a bit thicker. The chicken in the tikka masal was very good and very moist (yes, I know a lot of people hate that word. It's a good word to use in this case! ). The vindaloo was decent, except that the chunks of meat and potato were enormous. I was taught to eat Indian food by a Sri Lankan, which means I eat with my hands. I'm not used to having to pick up a giant wedge of potato and figuring out how to eat it cleanly. The mutter paneer was also alright, but the paneer was kind of tough and not soft like I'm used to. nnLike I said, it hit the spot, but I wouldn't order the vindaloo again, and I'm iffy on the paneer. Maybe it needs to be more fresh? I don't know how paneer works. The biggest issue was the salt level in the food. There was WAY. TOO. MUCH. SALT. If you are one of those people who loves to add salt, then this is all for you. I will give it another try, but only if they might agree to ease up on the salt.. . a lot.",

Others have commented on this already, but I really didn't care for the decor or the atmosphere. The lighting doesn't really work - the restaurant is too bright - and the furniture and flooring just really aren't up to snuff for a restaurant that's going to charge these kinds of prices. Truth be told, the place reminds me a lot of a funeral parlor.. . Yeah, I know. nnFor an appetizer we ordered a salad - priced over $9 - and we told them that we were going to share it. They split the salad, served it on two plates, and charged us a $2. 50 \"split plate fee\". You're kidding, right? The salad was good, but not even close to being worth the nearly $12 that they ended up charging us for it. My friend ordered the Mediterranean sampler from the appetizer menu, and she enjoyed her food - and I am at least glad for that. My entree, the scallops served with risotto, was fine but overpriced. For $24 I received three scallops on a bed of risotto. The risotto was undercooked. The flavor was fine, but for $24 the risotto should be better than average - especially when there are only three scallops. nnTo me, this is quintessential \"high end\" Charlotte dining - decent food that is absurdly priced. If they had charged $8 for our salads and $18 for my entree.. . it would have been a reasonable value.

Examples: Omelet = $18, and it is greasy, tasteless, and they used canned mushrooms; Breakfast buffet (the reason I got the omelet) is typically left to become stale and lukewarm; Dinner choices are typically salty (i.e. Fattoush salad) and greasy (i.e. sandwiches and burgers). I will say that the pancakes were excellent, but they are not the best (nor do they beat Hyatt's pancakes). nn2. LOCATION. While the Omni and other comparable hotels surround restaurants, shopping, and other area attractions, this hotels is 5 blocks from anywhere (even a pharmacy). Need I say more? nn3. SERVICE. No doorman, concierge has no good suggestion but \"Try Ember, \" and housekeeping seems to come only when you are in your room. On housekeeping, I am also quite sure they do not even vacuum as some cracker crumbs I spilled were still there TWO days later. They also tend to forget some essential (i.e. washcloth or soap). nnIf this were a cheap, sub-$100 per night hotel, I would manage. For Charlotte, which is not terribly in demand, this hotel should be spotless, sexy, or at least charming. It is neither, and for that reason, I suggest one try other hotels before this one.",

Safe in room, but other than that, no in room bling. Not a fan of the open shower at all. I like a nice shower with good water pressure. The shower in this room has a seat and a hand held shower head. It's not enclosed and there is no tub. To be fair, the shower head is on a mount that can be adjusted for height and direction, but the result is less than adequate water pressure. Any more and you would flood the bathroom. nnStaff is very friendly and helpful. Check in was uneventful and you can check out via the phone in your room. Final bill is shoved under your room door on the morning of your check out. nnBar/Restaurant is typical. Overpriced, but you have other choices. Dining options immediately around the hotel are limited. Subway, The Great Wok, Cedar Street Tavern are within short walking distance and are fine if you don't want or need to go downtown for better dining. nnThere is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within short walking distance. nnParking is $13 a day in a structure next to the hotel. In room internet is $9. 95 for 24 hours. I understand a parking charge, but it seems a bit steep. I simply do not understand any hotel charging for Wi-Fi access in room when it's free in the lobby and other public spaces of the hotel. nnMinor quibbles, but If I were attending a multi-day conference at the Convention Center, I'd look for a hotel closer. Price would be close to a wash and convenience would be better.",

It had an interesting mix of flavors but the outside tasted more like a thin corn taco. n3) Crostini (Filet Mingon): 3 small, flavor and lifeless filets over jam on a white bread crostini. n4) Souvlaki (beef skish-kabobs): Again, light on flavor, over cooked. nnI don't recommend this place, at least for tapas and I won't go back for a full dinner but the atmosphere was laid back, the service was very good and if you work in the area it seems like a good spot to stop in for a drink.

The second time though, I had a 3 hour layover, so I was able to do some wandering. nnCustoms and Immigration was about average in terms of time and service. When I got through, I had to go through security again. This was the main weird part for me. There was a VERY high tech security scanning system that was not your typical metal detector. You have to stand and turn and then they scan you. JFK is my main airport, and nothing there even comes close to the CIA system in place here. And it's safe to say JFK has a much higher demand for an elaborate security system than CDT. nnMy next complaint was that the result of this security system, the line moved verrrryyyyyy slowwwwly. It was not streamlined at all, and it took much longer than necessary because the employees were just really laid back and not in any rush. This didn't affect me because I'm a lunatic who leaves exorbitant amounts of time in between airline connections, but it IS a US Air hub and some people need to make their connections! Pick up the pace guys! nnOnce I got through, there was a nice central atrium with Adirondack chairs and then dated low-ceilinged hubs with generic seating areas. The central atrium was actually pleasant to spend some time in. As far as food goes, there was typical stuff, but also a Papa John's. It's nice to not have to rely on Sbarro and Famous Famiglia, and my Papa John's was pretty tasty.

I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent.

We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).

We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \"we can't split this salad. \" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. nnThe main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - sautu00e9ed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it.

Further back you go the more spacious it gets, but it never seems to be utilized correctly. nnEvery time I am there there seems to be something going on which entails that there will always be a cover charge which ranges from $1 for amateur stripper night to $5 for a drag show upstairs. That's another thing I cannot comprehend about this place, you have two floors of space but if an event is not taking place you only use one floor causing people to be crammed around the bar by the main entrance (yes, I'm still complaining about that). nnKaraoke night here isn't as bad as other local establishments, people can actually sing. Drinks are reasonable priced. Bartenders are attentive. That is if you can make to the bar for a drink. nnOne bad drawback about this place is that every once in a while you have a random person roaming around asking if you want to buy drugs off them. Crack is whack.",

Did it meet all the hype? Not so sure. The burgers good, but it wasn't anything spectacular as I thought it would be. Honestly, I like Burgatory a lot better. I ordered the Bacon Bleu Cheeseburger with dry bleu cheese. Probably mistake on my part. I thought the dry bleu cheese would be more crumbly and less creamy, but the heat of the burger melted it and it became creamy anyways (I dislike creamy things in general). Didn't enjoy the burger half as much because of that, but again mistake on my part. The home fries that came with it could have used some more seasoning, but with lots of ketchup it was tasty enough. nnThe service was up to par. I came with a huge party and they seated us and took our orders with no problem. They even stuck a candle into my friend's burger for her birthday. Overall, I'd give this place a 3. 5 stars.",

After about three weeks, though, my hair started looking as though I had just received a bowl-cut - the hair from the top of my head was longer than the hair on the sides of my head, and it was growing down over the sides! The next time I returned, I made an appointment with a different stylist. Again, great haircut at first, but after about three weeks it started happening again, albeit to a lesser degree. The next time I went in, I decided to stick with the same stylist - Erika - as she was friendly (unlike the first, rather quiet and somewhat abrasive stylist) and seemed to be eager to give me a haircut the I liked! I let her know how the previous haircut went wrong, and she actually took what I told her and made changed. Apparently my head is somewhat square-shaped at the top, and if the top is cut a different length from the rest, then it must be done with a narrower section to avoid the issue I'd been having. After all said and done, I left with a great cut that looked great for a solid two months before I went in again. I got one more cut with Erika, and then pre-booked my next cut. nnWhen I went in for THIS cut, I got to the front desk for my appointment time, told them I had a 12: 15 with Erika, and was then told \"Oh. Erika left. Let's see if we can get you in with someone else. \"nnThey didn't call me to tell me that Erika had quit. They didn't even reschedule my appointment with another stylist when she did. I was lucky enough to get in with one when I showed up, but it was back to square one with another haircut-turned-bowl-cut. nnIt's no wonder Erika quit - she was too good for the place!

It was a very simple dish and for $28 I would expect something more complex. The sauce was everywhere, overpowering the cheese, procuito and mushrooms and there was nothing to counter it.

There was also a little playground based on Harry Potter for the kids to play in, and they liked that.

When my burger came out, it was not a portabello mushroom patty, but instead, a pile of sliced mushrooms on the bun. I asked the server, why it was not a portabello patty, and the server told me it was because they had run out of portabello patties, and this was what they were using instead. Interesting. I told him I didn't want this, and wanted something else. He obliged, took my plate of sliced mushrooms, and went to place my new order. I called the manager over, to let them know the situation. When I explained my side of the story, he rebutted with something \"Well the server told you we were out of portabello mushroom patties, and said you agreed to sliced mushrooms\". WHAT?! I told him, no, that was incorrect, and that I was unware of them being out of portabello patties until I was brought a plate of sliced mushrooms on a bun; my wife agreed. The manager stood by his server. I firmly told him again, that I did not know/agree to having a sliced mushroom sandwich, and that the server conveyed no such message of running out of portabellow patties. I asked him how he could rectify the situation - free meal or something? No he would not, because I was aware of the situation (but I wasn't! ), although he did comp me the original portabello mushroom burger.. . gee thanks. nnNow I'm not the type of guy who tries to find fault at every little thing to get a free meal. But come on. I would assume, after having worked in the restaurant industry for several years, that the manager, regardless of how much/little he believed the customer (me) would side w/ me, or at least try to rectify the sitatuion for future business. But no, instead, he stuck w/ his server, made an unhappy customer, and now I will not visit there on my own volition (my wife enjoys the place, so I will go back w/ her, only urging).",

I did not have to make this stop, but after driving 450 miles, I wanted a decent meal. nnWell, I stopped by and order the Dish for carry out. When I open them(it was not long, 30 minutes or less), they were so soggy, and based on my experience who grew up on Chinese food, it was not fried the second time. The difference? They tasted worse than Buffet dish sitting above the steamer for hours. nnFurthermore, I have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce. Shrimp was hard to chew. It seems like the shrimp the simmered in the sauce for ages. There was no aroma from garlic or onion. nnBeing a decent cook myself, I can tell you those dishes I ordered were not cooked by the main chef, or secondary chef. I suspect this is  probably made by the guy who station the fryer. Truly, the taste of those two dishes were so awful, I toss them out. I purchase those passing Pittsburgh, not really possible asking for refund. nnI have had so much memory with this place. Rest assured, I won't be coming ever.

I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different. The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great. It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in. ) Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all. nnThe negatives: nnDim lighting that makes me want to sleep. It's not romantic, just dim. nnThe only waitress I've had there is pretty rude. She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general. My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.

It's all subpar grub, but my penchant for getting filet-o-fish sandwiches this time of year lives on anyway, so I had to go satiate my once-a-year craving. nnMy issue was with the service. I walked in and the employees were just chatting it up with their friends and off-hours coworkers who were on the customer side of the counter. It was around 11pm and the lack of customers inside of the restaurant made it pretty obvious that I was the only person waiting for my order to be taken, but that didn't stop the employees behind the counter from finishing their conversations before taking my order. nnAfter I finally put my order in, I seemed to wait an eternity (in fast food terms) for my two filet-o-fish sandwiches, regular McBites, and medium french fry order. It was hardly a complicated order, but I've waited less time during peak hours at other fast food chains in the past. Thankfully, there was ONE girl working who saw me standing there for a long time, and asked, \"are his McBites up yet?. .. where are they? \" I was happy that someone had finally addressed the situation, but it shouldn't have taken that long. nnAgain, I'm aware that showing up at 11pm will probably increase my odds of walking into a late-night, preparing-for-the-next-day mess of a restaurant, but even in fast food, it's absurd to think that the level of cleanliness that I walked into is acceptable. Not to mention, the one girl who was working announcing that she was \"going to pee\"  while I was standing there. I wasn't offended at all, but I found it odd that she thought that was acceptable to say in front of a customer. nnI guess this experience reminded me of why I limit my trips to fast food chains as much as possible.",

The prosciutto and Gorgonzola were plentiful, though I'm not sure of the quality of prosciutto they use. It looked burnt and perhaps prepackaged like bacon bits. It was just okay as a whole.

We were a party of 8 and were crowded around a round table. Five of us ordered the Pasta Trio and it was the BEST fettuccine and ravioli! The pasta was fresh and the taste was out of this world! The disappointment came when we wanted more. We sat at length waiting for seconds after our initial taste trio. When we were served again, I received a spoonful of fettuccine - one to three bites. Our drinks, other than water, were only refilled once. I ended up switching from iced tea to water, not by choice but before I noticed, my tea glass was filled with water. I was also bumped throughout the meal by wait staff walking between me and a temporary wall that was put up to accommodate a large birthday party. Fortunately I can get good pasta with much better service elsewhere. I really wish I could say otherwise but I will not be back and wouldn't recommend this location unless maybe for lunch or a less busy evening. I am pretty sure if Lidia experienced the service in her own restaurant she would be appalled!",

I think the \"schtick\" here is the family style entrees. When you order spaghetti and meatballs, you get a huge bowl of spaghetti with 2 or 3 meatballs the size of of a softball. The meatballs were not very good and it was kinda awkward dividiing them up. I'd rather have 8-10 smaller meatballs to share. nnThe atmosphere of the place is great.. . very Italian feel. Can't rival a joint in the North End of Boston but they try. nnSuggestion to the restaurant - move your dumpster. It sits prominently in the parking area on the same side as the main entrance.

Now we know. The service was impeccable, and we thought the restaurant was spotlessly clean. The food was spot on - from the shumai (tastes like it's made from scratch) to the Taipei Special Dumplings (which have a tasty thin exterior and a rich, savory pork filling), we enjoyed our appetizers very much. nnThe main dishes were equally as nice - we had the crispy shrimp and broccoli (lightly battered crispy shrimp and a great sweet chili garlic sauce) and at our waiter's suggestion, the basil rice noodles with chicken. I must say that the basil rice noodle dish was the best of the day; flavorful thin chicken slices with fresh basil tossed in with the delicious noodles and a little bit of sauce. The dish just works.. . Like other Chinese restaurants, the portions are large, and we probably should have only ordered one entree for the two of us after enjoying the two appetizers. Food was served at the correct temperature, too, which is something I always look for. (I hate it when food is too hot or too cold when it is served! )nnThere is room for improvement with regards to the actual menu - it's too big, and has too many items on too many pages, making it a bit difficult to make up ones' mind, but this is hardly unique to Taipei, and I would say 99% of Chinese restaurants have this problem.. . nnPrices are reasonable, and overall, it was a nice Saturday lunch experience. nnWill definitely be back.",

This rink just didn't blow my mind. nnWe arrived right when the open skate time started (check their website for the schedule). The entry process is pretty simple. Walk to the building, pay your money ($10 for admission and skate rental) and grab your rental skates at the next window. nnThe negatives.. . I was disappointed by the ice quality and the rental skates. The surface of the ice was pretty rough and needed a serious resurfacing. The rental skates were extremely dull. Yes, I know that they are rentals but it would have been nice if the blades had a decent edge. I also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink. This would have provided better separation for general skaters (the people that just want to skate circles) from the more experienced/technical skaters (the people that want to spin and jump). I've been to rinks that used the cones and it provided a better experience for all skaters. It would have been helpful if all skaters were aware of skating etiquette.. . There were also a few times that I found myself having to dodge people going the wrong direction!! nnThe positives.. . They serve beer and wine!! If it wasn't so early in the day, I would have partaken. The employees that I interacted with seemed friendly enough. nnPineville Ice House doesn't have a lot of competition, which means they really don't need to change much to stay in business.

It's on the mezzanine level (2nd floor) of a some financial building and when I got there, the exterior doors to the building were locked and luckily a group of people showed up and punched in the code to get one of the side doors opened.. . it was strange. However, when you walk in that side door, I was faced with the stairwell with trash cans spewed about. when I entered the pizza/sandwich joint, it was in disarray, bread was in crates on the floor and trash cans were overflowing. The bathroom was in a construction zone and filthy. All of this added up to being afraid to eat anything because you were unsure as to how fresh the food was and how well kept the kitchen may or may not have been. I'm not a fluffy guy, but I need some fluff in my establishments.. . look clean, feel clean, feel safe and I can live with whatever you dish out, but when first impressions are nasty and dirty, it hits homeplate way before the food hits my mouth. I still like the pizza and I will only send my pot smoking, beer drinking partying friends to this place, because I would be afraid of what others may think of it and consequently, think of me and my tastes.",

They also only use San Marzano tomatoes in the marinara sauces which introduces a bold rich flavor without as much acidity. The key to these dense, deep red fruits is that they are grown in the fertile volcanic soil in Italy. The Siciliana is an eggplant based dish that I find myself desiring often in my favorite dish spankbank. The perfect texture of the al dente pasta combined with the melt in your mouth salty, tart smoothness of the mozzarella and eggplant in the sweet heavily basil based garlic sauce is a party for the taste buds. I just keep eating until I am uncomfortably full. The wine selection is also above par, I enjoy the Berro Barberra. Full bodied, spicy, splashes of berry, and low in tannins. nnAs for the pizza, it is reminiscent of the famous brick oven pizzas of Da Michele found in only Napoli. The crust is extremely thin, light. and crispy. Follow that with my \"Piu00e8ce de ru00e9sistance\" mozzarella di bufala, tangy san marzano tomato sauce, and fresh leaves of basil you will find that simplicity is more.

The Pulled Pork sandwich was also a hit with my family. nnAs for desserts.. .. they have root beer floats. And that's enough for me. Do they take any skill? No none at all. Is it still wonderful to see one pop up on a menu? Oh yes. nnService has always been very efficient and polite, no complaints or rude servers. Atmosphere is nice but a little too dark and loud for my tastes. Patio usually fills up, but if you set up near the big windows, it's almost the same thing but with AC. nnAnd they're open late (1: 30) which is a huge plus for Pittsburgh.

I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. nnThe first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear. ) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town. nnThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet! nnA final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation.

This was the first time that she did not finish her dish (Chicken Cacciatore). She is not super picky, so this really meant she did not like it. nnThe type of food here is comparable to Olive Garden in terms of American-Italian fare, but I would rather eat at Olive Garden anyday. OG just tastes better and is way cheaper. nnSERVICE: nMediocre at best. The waters were not kept filled. Not a huge deal for me since I drink slowly, but some of my friends kept looking for the water and it clearly distracted them from their dining experience. The Pasta Trio is \"all you can eat\" and they come back to refill your plate. A few of us were waiting on the third round.. . and we never got it. Even though the food was not the tastiest, we were hungry and still needed to be fed. The wait staff didn't even ask if we wanted a third serving, and just took our plates quickly without giving us a chance. A few of us were still left a little bit hungry.. . it was a grumpy ride home: ( nnIMPRESSIONS: nRelative to the pricing of the food, I expected better quality. Even if the pricing was on par with comparable establishments, the quality of the food was lacking. I hate to say this, but we had a disappointing experience overall, from the food to the service.",

        "text": "I moved to Pittsburgh from Seattle where you can find some of the absolute best Vietnamese food. This place is a hole-in-the-wall with a very brusque owner/waiter and kind of dingy decor. I don't mind any of these things actually, but the food I definitely took some issue with. I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can't remember the name) served over rice. My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl. Our food came fast enough and it was served hot. However, my dish was nothing to brag about. It was pretty average tasting Asian fare. It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality. Good thing it was only about 6 bucks. My boyfriend's dinner was a real disappointment, however. My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles. The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection. Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll. The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all. It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion. The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something. It almost looked like boiled ground beef. I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious. As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars! Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for. I don't understand this either. The rolls were extremely bland and chewy. The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere. Also, please take note they only accept cash and no cards.",

This machine actually made my body vibrate. It was strange. nnSo far it was a five star experience but it was soon time to inject me with the radioactive contrast material. Things started going downhill after the MRI tech & another tech attempted to inject me with the material & instead collapsed my veins in both my arms. They next wanted to try my hands and I refused. I told them to butterfly it into a vein on a forearm. Their response was to stick the needle into my left wrist. The contrast was then pushed into the vein burning its way along.

The inside looks very modern with a lot of wood and glass material and is spacious with multiple floors. There is complimentary valet parking at Soba which makes parking easy. nnWe chose the crispy calamari as an appetizer and shared the thakkali curry and pad thai for the entrees. The crispy calamari was okay - similar to crispy calamari I had at other restaurants. The thakkali curry was very salty and there was not enough liquid to balance out all the vegetables. We had trouble eating the curry as the sauce was very pungent. The pad thai was nothing spectacular - definitely had better in NYC and Philadelphia. The portion sizes of all the food that we ordered were very generous.

I called the hotel to explain my situation and asked to change my reservation, but the receptionist was not having it. She was completely unsympathetic to my plight and insisted me to pay for the night that I'm not staying.

Why would a Marriott hotel have an AC unit that's louder than my grandma's AC unit from the 1980s is completely beyond me. nnSeriously reconsider if you decide to live here.

Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn't want to be seen. Classy. nnSame one was working the last time we went,  it was dead and she still couldn't keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with \"give me a second I have to get this for these people first\"  and then she would look at her phone. I mean I don't expect the best service on a Friday night somewhere but when it's dead and you can't even come close to keeping up what the hell are you doing. nnOn the bright side we got bread with our meal for the first time in the last four visits this time so.. ..  progress I guess.

You know how when you get a jokey waiter when you're not \"that kind\" of table, you expect the waiter to get the hint and be more professional? Well I had the exact opposite experience. My very small office was saying goodbye to one of our coworkers, so we went to Lidia's for a boozy lunch. We were in high spirits and having a great time. The waiter was perfectly courteous and professional, but I thought he should have gotten that we were a more personable table. Anyway, I didn't knock off a star for this, it doesn't seem important enough. But it did taint my visit. I remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food. nnOh, and don't bother with the tiramisu, it's all cream, almost no cake. nnBut the atmosphere is great, they really went all out with the interior design. The menu isn't particularly veg friendly, but it's not too bad. Lidia's does high-end traditional Italian without being too pretentious or too predictable. But I have no desire to eat what I ordered (the daily special pasta trio) again nor do I have any interest in trying anything else on the menu. Months later I decided to lower my stars from four to two. I really wanted to like this place, but I really didn't. nnAnd I gotta talk about that wine list again, it's Lidia's only shining star. Of course, they have a pricey reserve list, but they have a whole bunch of really cheap, good bottles, and a bunch of wines by the glass too.",

Some places make awesome rolls, but that seems to be to hide the not-freshness of the fish. Others have great fresh fish, but can't make a roll to save their lives. nnThis place does it all. J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed. I started with some hot sake and a green salad. Their ginger dressing is delish! I was practically licking the bowl. I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came. J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best. The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness. Then came the sushi. We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop. What can I say, we like sushi. The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy. The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here. However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna. Everyone does a spicy tuna. At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll. Both excellent. nnWhile I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon.",

The extensive collection of his iconic artworks left me in awe of his creative genius and his profound impact on pop art. Another notable stop was the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, where I was surrounded by breathtaking flora and immersed in the tranquility of nature.Food enthusiasts will rejoice in Pittsburgh's restaurant scene, which offers a diverse array of culinary delights. I savored every bite of the mouthwatering pierogies at a local Polish eatery, and the juicy Primanti Brothers sandwich packed with french fries and coleslaw was a true indulgence. For dessert, the local bakeries didn't disappoint as I relished in the delectable flavors of a freshly baked burnt almond torte.Exploring Pittsburgh's neighborhoods was an adventure in itself. Lawrenceville, with its vibrant street art and hipster vibe, captured my attention with its quirky shops and trendy cafes. The Strip District, on the other hand, immersed me in a multicultural tapestry of sights, sounds, and aromas, as I wandered through its bustling markets and tried various international delicacies.To discover more of the city's past, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was an absolute must-visit.

The ambience was lackluster, with dim lighting and outdated decor that did not create a welcoming atmosphere. The service was equally disappointing, as the staff seemed indifferent and inattentive throughout the entire meal.Moving on to the menu, it appeared promising at first glance. A wide variety of options was available, catering to different tastes. Unfortunately, the execution fell short of expectations. I ordered their signature dish, but it arrived lukewarm and lacked the depth of flavors expected from such a renowned dish. The portion size was also underwhelming, leaving me unsatisfied.Furthermore, the prices were exorbitant for the quality provided. The value for money simply did not align with the overall dining experience. It was clear that the establishment was resting on its reputation rather than consistently delivering top-notch cuisine.To make matters worse, the wait time for the food was significantly longer than anticipated. It felt like an eternity before our plates finally arrived. By that point, my enthusiasm had waned, and I had lost all interest in savoring the meal.I did, however, appreciate the effort put into presentation. The dishes were artfully arranged and visually appealing. Unfortunately, appearances couldn't salvage the lackluster experience.The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was also hindered by the noise levels. It was difficult to carry on a conversation without raising our voices to be heard above the din of other patrons.On the positive side, the beverage selection was commendable, offering a diverse range of options. The wine list, in particular, was extensive and well-curated, providing some respite from the disappointing meal.As for dessert, it was the only highlight of the entire experience.",

Once seated, the wait for our order was excruciatingly long, and when the food finally arrived, it was cold and tasteless.The menu boasted a variety of options, but the reality was far from appetizing. The presentation of the dishes was lackluster, resembling something hastily thrown together rather than carefully prepared. The ingredients seemed stale, and the flavors were bland, lacking any depth or creativity. It was evident that no attention to detail was paid in the kitchen.Adding insult to injury was the abysmal service. Our server was inattentive and seemed bothered whenever we asked for anything. One of our orders was completely forgotten and arrived when everyone else had already finished their meals. The apology from the server was insincere and lacked any attempt to rectify the situation.Moreover, the overall ambiance of the restaurant was disappointing. The decor was outdated and worn, giving off a dingy and neglected vibe. The noise level was deafening, making it impossible to have a conversation without shouting. The lack of proper lighting made the whole experience feel gloomy and uninviting.Despite all these flaws, the prices were shockingly high. The hefty bill was nothing short of an insult considering the subpar quality of the food and service. It's disheartening to think that this establishment has the audacity to charge such exorbitant amounts for an experience that falls far below expectations.In conclusion, my initial skepticism of 1-star reviews on Yelp has been shattered. This restaurant truly deserves every negative comment it receives.",

Our group decided to start with their famous loaded nachos and a plate of crispy calamari. The nachos were generously topped with mouthwatering cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa, making for an irresistible combination of flavors. The calamari was perfectly cooked, with a light and crispy coating that complemented the tender seafood.For the main course, we explored various options to cater to everyone's preferences.

I personally went for the grilled salmon, served with a side of seasoned vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes. The salmon was impeccably cooked, with a delicate flakiness that melted in my mouth.The portions at Rock Bottom are certainly generous, ensuring that none of us left with an empty stomach. We couldn't resist indulging in their tempting dessert menu, so we ordered a shared platter of their signature chocolate lava cake and a refreshing fruit sorbet.

It lacks the velvety smoothness and creaminess that would elevate it to greatness. Nevertheless, the sundaes are a delightful indulgence, generously topped with whipped cream, hot fudge, and a cherry on top. The splits are equally satisfying, with their generous portions of ice cream, fresh fruit, and decadent sauces creating a harmonious medley of flavors. As for the milkshakes, they are thick, rich, and wonderfully blended, transporting you to milkshake heaven with each sip.

Despite this setback, I decided to give the food a chance, hoping it would make up for the lackluster surroundings. Unfortunately, the menu options were limited and unimaginative.

However, when my food finally arrived, I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed. The presentation lacked finesse, and the flavors fell flat. It was as if the chef played it safe, opting for mediocrity instead of daring to push the boundaries. Despite my disappointment, I decided to give the dessert a chance, hoping it would redeem the meal. Regrettably, even the sweet finale failed to impress.

As I left the restaurant, I couldn't help but wonder if it would ever live up to its full potential. Perhaps with some adjustments, both in terms of menu variety and ambiance, this place could become the vibrant gem Regent Square deserves. However, for now, it falls short of my expectations.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a somewhat disinterested hostess who seemed more preoccupied with her phone than with welcoming guests. The atmosphere lacked the sophistication and elegance we've come to associate with Morton's. The restaurant felt dimly lit and outdated, with worn-out furnishings that could use some refreshing. We were promptly seated, but it took quite a while for our server to approach our table. Throughout the evening, the service remained slow and inattentive. Our water glasses were left empty for long periods, and it was difficult to get the attention of our server whenever we needed something. As for the food, it was disappointing compared to our previous experiences at Morton's. We started with the shrimp cocktail, which was average at best. The shrimp lacked freshness and tasted bland, and the cocktail sauce lacked the tanginess and spiciness we expected. For the main course, we ordered the ribeye steak and the surf and turf. The ribeye was cooked well, but it lacked the flavorful seasoning and succulence we've come to love in Morton's steaks. The surf and turf dish was underwhelming—the lobster was overcooked and rubbery, and the filet mignon was overdone and lacked the tenderness we expected. The sides we ordered, including the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, were mediocre. They lacked the depth of flavor and richness that we've experienced in other Morton's locations. The portion sizes were also smaller than anticipated, which left us feeling unsatisfied. To add to our disappointment, the dessert options were limited and uninspiring. We decided to pass on dessert altogether, as nothing on the menu piqued our interest. Overall, our dining experience at Morton's in Pittsburgh was far from impressive.

The routes are creative and thoughtfully set, incorporating interesting features and movement sequences. I thoroughly enjoyed working on the different problems and challenging myself to improve my technique. The crash pads are ample and in good condition, providing a safe landing for falls. The atmosphere in the bouldering section is generally positive, with climbers encouraging each other and offering helpful beta. However, I did notice that the cleanliness of the mats could be improved, as there were some chalk and dirt buildup in certain areas. One downside is the limited seating available near the bouldering area, which can be inconvenient during busy times when you need a break or want to observe others climbing. Additionally, the overall facility could benefit from better ventilation as it tends to get quite hot and stuffy. Despite these minor drawbacks, if you're primarily interested in bouldering and looking for a solid indoor climbing experience in Pittsburgh, this place is definitely worth checking out.",

Finally, when one of the receptionists reluctantly approached me, they didn't greet me with a friendly demeanor or offer any assistance.As I patiently waited for my turn, I couldn't help but notice the disarray at the front desk. Files were scattered, and the staff seemed flustered, constantly misplacing important documents. It was clear that they were understaffed and lacked proper training. This chaos made me question whether this establishment truly valued its customers or their experience.Regrettably, my concerns were only exacerbated during my actual appointment. The hairstylist assigned to me appeared rushed and inattentive. Despite providing clear instructions, my cut didn't come out as desired, leaving me feeling dissatisfied. I brought this up with the front desk staff, hoping for a resolution, but they gave me a dismissive response. It was disheartening to see that my concerns were not taken seriously or addressed promptly.Considering the lack of professionalism I experienced throughout my visit, I decided against giving this salon another chance. It's a shame because Emilio, the owner, seemed genuinely committed to customer satisfaction. However, without a strong and competent front desk team, the overall experience falls short.I believe that any establishment, particularly in the service industry, should prioritize effective communication, organization, and a welcoming atmosphere for its clients.

I arrived for my appointment and was greeted by a receptionist who seemed uninterested and barely acknowledged my presence. After a short wait, my stylist finally appeared and immediately gave off a vibe of disinterest as well. I showed him a picture of the hairstyle I wanted, explaining it in detail, hoping he would understand my vision. Unfortunately, it became clear that he wasn't paying attention at all. He proceeded to apply color without consulting me on the shade or even discussing the process. I sat there feeling uneasy, but I hoped for the best. nnAs he left me to process the color, I couldn't help but notice the chaotic atmosphere in the salon. The stylists seemed more interested in socializing among themselves than in providing quality service to their clients. Nobody bothered to check on me or offer any refreshments during the entire process. After what felt like an eternity, my hair was finally rinsed, and it was time for the haircut. As he started cutting, it was evident that my stylist had no idea what he was doing. He seemed to be rushing through it, not paying attention to the details and disregarding my desired style completely. When he was finished, I glanced at myself in the mirror, and I was horrified. My hair looked nothing like the picture I had shown him, and it was a complete mess. I tried to voice my concerns, but my stylist brushed me off, saying it was the best he could do. nnFeeling utterly disappointed, I left the salon fighting back tears. Not only did I waste my money on the Groupon, but I also ended up with a hairstyle that made me want to hide away from the world. The whole experience at Crimpers was a nightmare, from the lackluster customer service to the stylist's incompetence. I would strongly advise anyone considering a Groupon deal for this salon to think twice and invest their money elsewhere.",

It took forever for our server to take our drink orders, and even longer for the drinks to actually arrive at our table. The appetizers we ordered were also delayed, and when they finally arrived, they were lukewarm and didn't taste fresh. The main courses were a complete letdown as well. My chicken was overcooked and dry, and some of my guests complained that their steak was underseasoned and tough to chew. It seemed like the kitchen staff was overwhelmed and unable to handle the volume of orders. Moreover, the atmosphere was far from enjoyable. The private event space felt cramped and dimly lit, creating a rather gloomy ambiance. The tables were not properly set up, and some of the chairs were wobbly and uncomfortable. To make matters worse, the air conditioning wasn't working properly, leaving everyone feeling hot and sweaty throughout the entire shower. The lack of attention to detail was evident, and it made me question my decision to choose Rock Bottom for such an important event. Despite the disappointing experience, the only saving grace was the dessert. The chocolate cake we had was absolutely delicious and seemed to be the only thing that went right that day. However, one good dessert could not make up for all the other shortcomings. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with my bridal shower at Rock Bottom. I had high expectations based on my previous visits, but unfortunately, they failed to deliver. I would not recommend hosting any special events at this establishment, as they seem ill-equipped to handle them properly.",

It's not every day you come across professionals who take the time to explain things rather than just rushing through the process.Within a short span of time, they had my tire all patched up and ready to go. Not only was the repair top-notch, but the price was also reasonable, especially considering the stress I had been through. It's such a relief when you don't feel like you're being taken advantage of.The staff at Walter's Automotive went above and beyond to turn my frustrating experience into a positive one. I left their shop feeling grateful and relieved, knowing that my car was in excellent hands. Highly recommend them to anyone in need of automotive assistance. These guys know how to get you back on the road with a smile on your face!",

It's not one of those big, impersonal supermarkets where you feel like just another face in the crowd. No, this place has character.Now, let's get to the real star of the show: the products. Oh boy, they have everything you could ever need, and then some! From fresh produce to artisanal cheeses and everything in between, their selection is top-notch. I was blown away by the quality of their fruits and vegetables; it's like they handpicked them from the garden that morning. And let me tell you, their bakery section is to die for. The aroma of freshly baked bread fills the air, and their pastries are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.But it's not just the products that make this grocer great; it's the personal touch.

But let me tell you, I hit the jackpot when I found Dr. Johnson and his team at Animal Care Clinic! From the moment we walked through the door, we were greeted with warm smiles and a genuine love for animals. It instantly put my worries at ease. The staff took the time to get to know both me and my furry companion, asking about our story and any concerns I had. It made me feel like they truly cared, not just about their job, but about the well-being of my cat. During our first visit, Dr. Johnson conducted a thorough examination, checking my cat from head to tail and answering all my questions patiently. He explained each procedure and treatment plan in simple terms, making sure I understood everything. It was clear that he valued communication and wanted to ensure I played an active role in my pet's health care. I didn't feel rushed or pressured at all, which was a refreshing change from my previous vet experiences.One thing that really impressed me was how Dr. Johnson and his team went above and beyond to create a comfortable and stress-free environment for the animals. The clinic had calming music playing in the background, and the examination rooms were cozy and inviting. My cat, who usually gets spazzed out during vet visits, seemed surprisingly relaxed. It was evident that they understood the importance of reducing fear and anxiety in their patients, and it made a world of difference.Throughout the years, whenever my cat needed routine check-ups or the occasional medical attention, I always trusted Animal Care Clinic. The level of care and compassion they consistently provide is exceptional. The team is attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about what they do. They treat each animal as if they were their own, and that's something you don't find everywhere.In conclusion, I highly recommend Dr.",

The decorations were vibrant, with balloons of all colors adorning every corner of the room. As the party kicked off, the excitement grew even more, fueled by the energetic music playing in the background.The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the entertainment provided. A professional magician was hired to perform mind-boggling tricks that left both kids and adults in awe.

The organization of the party seemed a bit chaotic at times, with some confusion regarding the order of events. It caused a slight delay in the schedule, and understandably, with excited children eagerly awaiting their turn, patience wore thin.Nevertheless, overall, my friend's daughter's birthday party was a memorable and enjoyable experience. The joy on the little one's face and the laughter shared amongst the guests made it all worthwhile.

The ambiance, or lack thereof, definitely left much to be desired. The lighting was too bright, giving off a sterile and impersonal vibe that didn't create a pleasant dining atmosphere.Moving on to the service, it was painfully slow and inattentive. It took an eternity for the waitstaff to acknowledge our presence, let alone take our orders. We had to flag someone down just to get some water, and even then, they seemed annoyed by our request. Once we finally placed our orders, the wait for the food seemed never-ending. It felt like we were being forgotten in the chaos of the restaurant.When the food finally arrived, it was a sad sight. The presentation was lackluster, and the dishes themselves looked unappetizing. I took a bite of the supposed \"signature\" dish, and I have to say, it was flavorless and bland. The ingredients seemed low quality, and it was clear that no thought or effort had been put into the preparation. I couldn't help but wonder if they were cutting corners in the kitchen.To make matters worse, the portion sizes were ridiculously small for the prices they were charging. I felt like I had ordered from a fancy restaurant and received an appetizer-sized meal. It was a clear case of overpricing, and I left the place feeling not only unsatisfied but also ripped off. The value for money was simply nonexistent.The saddest part was that even the dessert, usually a saving grace, couldn't redeem the meal. We ordered their \"chef's special\" dessert, and it was a complete letdown. The presentation was sloppy, and the taste was underwhelming. It lacked the creativity and finesse that you would expect from a restaurant of this alleged caliber.",

It's not just their lack of driving skills that irks me; it's their attitude too. I've had multiple instances where I politely asked the driver behind me to stop tailgating, and guess what?

We particularly loved the combination of tangy marinara sauce, gooey mozzarella cheese, and the smoky goodness of the pepperoni. The pizza had the right balance of flavors, and it left us wanting more. The portions were generous, and we found ourselves happily indulging in a second round. The only minor drawback was that one of the pizzas arrived slightly lukewarm, but a quick pop in the oven fixed that.

As we entered the cozy Italian restaurant, the aroma of garlic and fresh basil filled the air, instantly awakening our appetites. The friendly waitress led us to our table and handed us menus, which boasted an impressive range of classic Italian dishes. Excitement filled the air as we eagerly anticipated a delightful culinary experience.After careful consideration, we settled on the Margherita pizza, a timeless favorite. Moments later, the pizza arrived at our table, and my eyes widened at the sight. It was abundantly adorned with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil leaves, each ingredient competing for attention. However, upon the first bite, it became clear that Mama Lucia's had gone a bit too far in their abundance.The overwhelming amount of toppings weighed heavily on the thin, delicate crust, causing it to become soggy and losing its desired crispiness. The flavors, although individually delicious, became muddled and lacked the harmony one would expect from a Margherita pizza. It was as if Mama Lucia's had thrown caution to the wind in pursuit of impressing customers with their generous portions.While it's admirable that Mama Lucia's wants to provide value for money, the excessive toppings and serving sizes ultimately detracted from the overall quality of the dish. In a quest for bountiful portions, they sacrificed the integrity of the pizza, leaving us with a mediocre experience.Had they exercised a lighter touch, allowing the simplicity and balance of the Margherita pizza to shine through, the result would have been a far more satisfying culinary journey. It's worth noting that other dishes we observed being served around us appeared to suffer from a similar fate, with overpowering portions overshadowing the delicate flavors they initially promised.",

On my visits, I've tried their famous grilled salmon and their juicy ribeye steak, and they were both delicious. The flavors were on point, and the presentation was impressive. The only downside is that sometimes the portions can be a bit small for the price you pay, but the taste makes up for it.One thing I appreciate about this restaurant is their commitment to using fresh, locally sourced ingredients. They have a farm-to-table approach, which means you can expect high-quality and seasonal ingredients in your dishes. It's a nice touch that adds to the overall dining experience and makes you feel good about supporting local farmers.In terms of pricing, I'd say it's a mid-range restaurant. It's not super expensive, but it's not cheap either. You're definitely paying for the quality of the food and the overall experience.

I was intrigued by the unique combination, so we decided to check it out. The moment we walked into the sandwich shop, we were hit with the aroma of freshly cooked fries and savory meats. The place had a cozy, retro vibe that immediately transported me back to the '90s.

As we took our first bite, the combination of textures and flavors was a delicious surprise. The coleslaw added a refreshing crunch, while the fries provided a satisfyingly crispy element. The roast beef was perfectly seasoned and juicy, tying everything together.The staff at the sandwich shop were friendly and accommodating, taking the time to explain their menu and answer our questions. The service was prompt, and we were seated in a booth overlooking the bustling street outside. It was the perfect spot to people-watch while savoring each delectable bite.To complement our sandwich, we ordered a side of their homemade dill pickle chips. They were thinly sliced and packed a punch of tangy, briny flavor. It was the ideal accompaniment to the robust flavors of the sandwich.The only hiccup in our experience was the long wait time for a table. The place seemed to be popular among locals and visitors alike, which led to a crowded space and limited seating. However, once we were seated, the attentive service made up for the initial inconvenience.Overall, if you're in Pittsburgh and looking for a truly unique sandwich experience, I highly recommend trying this place out.",

We started off with their famous bruschetta, which was a taste explosion of fresh tomatoes, basil, and garlic on crispy bread. Holy cow, it was delicious! For the main course, I opted for their signature pasta dish, the Peppi's Special, and it blew me away. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and the sauce was rich with flavors that danced on my palate.Word of caution: the portions at Peppi's are generous, so make sure to come hungry or be prepared to take home some leftovers. We couldn't resist trying their homemade tiramisu for dessert, and it was the perfect way to end the meal. Each bite was a heavenly combination of velvety mascarpone cheese, coffee-soaked ladyfingers, and a sprinkle of cocoa on top.I must mention the friendly and lively atmosphere at Peppi's. The restaurant was buzzing with laughter and chatter, creating a vibrant energy that added to the overall experience. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a fantastic evening, and I left feeling like I had made new friends.In conclusion, Peppi's is a true gem in the culinary scene. With its outstanding food, inviting ambiance, and exceptional service, it's a place I would happily recommend to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Tonight, my wife drove me over to Peppi's, and we're already planning our next visit. Thumbs up emoji all the way!",

However, what unfolded during my visit left me utterly disappointed and frustrated. The moment I entered the establishment, the atmosphere felt chaotic and disorganized. The staff seemed overwhelmed and were not attentive to the customers' needs.After finally managing to flag down a server, I placed an order for a cocktail and a couple of appetizers. Unfortunately, the wait time for my order was ridiculously long. I watched as other tables received their food and drinks before me, despite arriving later. It was as if my order had been forgotten entirely.When my food finally arrived, it was a far cry from what I had anticipated. The appetizers were lukewarm and tasted like they had been sitting out for far too long. The presentation was lackluster, with a half-hearted attempt at garnishing. But the worst part was discovering a hair in my one of my appetizers. The sheer negligence and lack of hygiene were appalling.In an attempt to salvage the situation, I decided to try one of their specialty burgers. Unfortunately, that turned out to be another disappointment. The patty was overcooked and dry, and the bun was stale. To make matters worse, there was something hard and inedible hidden amidst the toppings, almost as if proper care had not been taken during the preparation.The overall service was abysmal, with the waitstaff being inattentive and uninterested in addressing any concerns. When I voiced my dissatisfaction, the response I received was dismissive and apathetic. It was evident that they did not value their customers' feedback or take accountability for their shortcomings.Leaving the restaurant, I felt beyond flabbergasted. How on earth could this establishment have positive ratings? It was beyond me.",

This little gem of a neighborhood joint has been serving up delicious ice cream and mouthwatering burgers since I was a kid. Every time I visit, I'm instantly transported back to my carefree days of chasing the ice cream truck down the street with sticky fingers and a big smile on my face.Walking into Page's Dairy Mart feels like stepping into a time capsule. The old-fashioned decor, complete with vintage posters and checkered floors, takes me on a nostalgic journey. The aroma of sizzling burgers on the grill wafts through the air, mingling with the sweet scent of freshly made waffle cones. It's a sensory experience that never fails to make me giddy with anticipation.One thing that sets Page's Dairy Mart apart is their unrivaled selection of ice cream flavors. From classic favorites like chocolate and vanilla to unique creations like salted caramel swirl and toasted coconut, there's something for every taste bud. Personally, I can never resist their signature sundae, \"The Works,\" piled high with hot fudge, sprinkles, whipped cream, and a cherry on top. It's pure indulgence in every heavenly spoonful.But it's not just the ice cream that keeps me coming back. The burgers at Page's Dairy Mart are a force to be reckoned with. Juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection, they are a carnivore's dream come true. And the toppings? Oh boy! You can load up your burger with all the classics like cheese, onions, and pickles, or go wild with jalapenos, bacon, and even a fried egg. The possibilities are endless, and the taste is out of this world.What truly sets Page's Dairy Mart apart, though, is the warm and welcoming atmosphere. The staff behind the counter always greets you with a smile, and their genuine friendliness makes you feel like part of the family.",

I sat there for what felt like an eternity before someone even bothered to take my order. And when they finally did, they got it all wrong. I specifically asked for no onions on my burger, but guess what? Yep, you guessed it, there were onions all over it! Talk about attention to detail.But that's not even the worst part. The food itself was just downright awful. I ordered the chicken parmigiana, expecting a flavorful, cheesy delight. Instead, what I got was a sad, dry piece of chicken drowning in a pool of tasteless tomato sauce. It was completely unappetizing. And don't even get me started on the side of limp, overcooked fries that came with it. The ambiance was another disappointment. The place was so cramped and noisy that I could hardly hear myself think. The tables were jammed together, and I felt like I was dining with the couple next to me. Not exactly the cozy, intimate dinner I had in mind. To make matters worse, the prices were exorbitant for the quality of food and service they provided. I felt ripped off and utterly unsatisfied. I've had better meals at half the price in a fast-food joint. I honestly can't understand how this place stays in business.I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. Save your hard-earned money and go somewhere else where you'll actually get good food and decent service. Trust me, you'll thank me later. This was definitely one dining experience I won't be forgetting anytime soon, and not in a good way.",

We were tired and hungry, looking forward to grabbing a bite before calling it a night. The restaurant had a lively atmosphere with dim lighting and upbeat music playing in the background. It seemed like the perfect place to unwind after a good laugh.Upon entering, we were greeted by a friendly hostess who promptly seated us. The menu offered a decent selection of comfort food options and pub classics, which seemed appealing given our late-night cravings. However, as we perused the menu, we couldn't help but notice the inflated prices for some of the dishes. It left us a bit hesitant, but we decided to give it a chance.We ordered the classic cheeseburger and a plate of buffalo wings, hoping for some delicious and satisfying flavors. Unfortunately, our high expectations quickly turned sour. The cheeseburger arrived looking quite appetizing, with its perfectly toasted bun and a thick juicy patty. But upon the first bite, it became evident that the burger was lacking in seasoning. The patty itself was disappointingly bland and lacked the juiciness we had anticipated.As for the buffalo wings, they were another letdown. The menu boasted about their spicy and flavorful sauce, but what we received was far from that. The wings were soggy and lacked the crispy texture we craved, while the sauce was watery and lacked any real kick. It was a far cry from the mouth-watering buffalo wings we had hoped for.To make matters worse, the service was subpar. Our waiter seemed disinterested and inattentive throughout the evening. It took quite some time for our food to arrive, and we had to flag down the waiter several times for drink refills. It left us feeling neglected and unimportant as customers.In terms of ambiance, Rock Bottom fell flat as well. The noise level was incredibly high, making it difficult to carry on a conversation without raising our voices.",

I stumbled upon it while exploring the neighborhood and was immediately drawn in by its charming exterior and inviting atmosphere. The moment I stepped inside, however, my expectations started to crumble. The ambiance was lackluster, with dim lighting and outdated decor that didn't match the initial appeal. It felt like stepping back in time rather than experiencing something unique and modern. To make matters worse, the service was far from satisfactory. The staff seemed disinterested and lacked the enthusiasm one would expect from a local business trying to make a mark. It took forever for someone to acknowledge my presence and even longer to get my order taken. The menu, though promising a variety of options, left much to be desired in terms of taste and presentation.Now, let me talk about the coffee – or lack thereof. As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast, I had high hopes for their brews, but I was sorely disappointed. The coffee tasted stale and lacked any distinctive flavor profiles that make a good cup of joe worth savoring. It was a letdown, to say the least.On top of that, the prices were unjustifiably high for the quality of the offerings. I wouldn't mind paying a bit extra for a unique experience or exceptional products, but that was far from the case here. It felt like they were trying to make a quick buck without putting in the effort to deliver on their promises.All in all, while this place has the potential to be a hidden gem in our community, it falls short in various aspects. From the lackluster ambiance to the subpar service and disappointing coffee, it's an unfortunate missed opportunity. I genuinely hope they take customer feedback to heart and make the necessary improvements because it would be a shame to see this potential go to waste.",

Trust me, I've tried other places, but none come close to the deliciousness and hangover-curing powers of this joint. The friendly staff completes the experience, always ready with a sympathetic smile and an extra slice of bacon if you need it.

It is commendable that the walls are regularly reset, but it does not compensate for the uncomfortable landing surfaces. Several times I landed with a jolt, which caused unnecessary strain on my joints. Moreover, the lack of responsiveness of the spring board makes it difficult to generate the momentum necessary for a successful climb. I often find myself struggling to gain the initial height needed to tackle the more difficult routes. This limitation can be frustrating, especially for climbers who are trying to improve their skills and push their limits. In addition to the safety concerns, the general upkeep of the gym leaves much to be desired. The lack of cleanliness is evident, with chalk dust and debris accumulating in the corners and crevices. It is disappointing to see a place that should be concerned with hygiene and presentation fall short in this regard. Another drawback is the limited variety of climbing routes available. It seems that after a few visits I have already exhausted most of the available options. The absence of an instructor or guide is also a missed opportunity. It would be beneficial to the appeal of the gym to introduce new routes and cater to climbers of different skill levels. The lack of adequate ventilation is another notable issue. Many climbers, especially beginners, would benefit from professional guidance and advice. Having someone experienced to offer tips, correct technique and offer support would enhance the overall climbing experience and create a sense of community within the gym.

Even the simplest requirements or modifications, they seem to be difficult to provide accurate meals. If they have a secret task to test the patience of customers, I will not be surprised. Regardless of the lack of ingredients, incorrect burgers are pouring their heads or mixing in drink selection, this place will become synonymous with disappointment. It's not only me; I have heard of many complaints from friends and colleagues who have experienced experiences here. Every time I visit, I don't pay attention to the details and care of the preparation order. Handling their mistakes has become an unpopular ceremony because I constantly find that I return to the counter to ask for correction. This inconsistent level is unacceptable at all, especially for such a huge fast food chain. I have reached the point where I would rather find a fast -bit replacement position, rather than making myself frustrated. Overall, the continuous improper order of order has severely damaged my opinion on this agency. I will warn anyone who seek reliable and accurate meals to avoid this specific branch.",

After careful consideration, I decided to start from the avocado, and there were poached eggs on it. The speech is impeccable, and the flavor is well coordinated. Baked bread is very crispy, and the eggs are cooked to perfect with flowing egg yolk, which adds a luxurious cream state to each bites. Next, I was addicted to the smoky salmon Benneditett. A combination of a matching, faint salmon, flowing eggs, and rich Dutch sauce were made in lunch paradise. This dish is accompanied by golden brown on one side, and these brown is perfectly seasoned. It seems that this is not enough, I can't resist trying to try fluffy cholecoppy pancakes. They are light and ventilated, and the texture of melting in their mouths is simply sacred. Fresh berries and powder sugar are placed on it, which is a pleasant sweet. Casba's breakfast drink menu is also impressive. I chose the bloody Mary they signed, but it was not disappointing. The bold taste of tomato juice, vodka and spices are very balanced, and the decoration of pickles and olives adds a good touch. In the rectification meal, this service is concentrated but not noticeable. The waiters are proficient in the menu knowledge and provide outstanding suggestions.

The tender steak is paired with cream cold rolls, and the fries increased the unique turning point, thereby increasing the overall experience. Not only is the sandwiches excellent, but the accompanying side is equally impressive. We can't resist trying their crispy onion circles, and they are the best onions in our history. The onion is perfectly cooked, and it has lightweight and crispy batter, which provides pleasant contrast. In order to wash the meal, we chose the local craft beer they provided. The choice is extensive. The knowledge of knowledge helps us choose the perfect beer to supplement the sandwich. The refreshing cold beer is the ideal accompaniment of this rich taste. When we taste food, we can't help but notice the concentration of service provided by the staff. They are quickly, friendly, and ensure that we have everything we need during the meal. The overall dining experience is first -class. The staff is committed to making our pleasant dedication spirit that has not attracted people's attention.

Despite our high hopes fueled by enticing marketing materials and positive reviews, the reality fell far short. The product was faulty and failed to deliver on its promises, indicating possible corners were cut during the manufacturing process.To compound our disappointment, the company's refund policy proved to be incredibly frustrating. They were hesitant to issue a refund and instead insisted on offering a replacement. Given our prior experience, we had no confidence in their ability to deliver a functional product. It seemed as though their priority was keeping our money rather than ensuring customer satisfaction.Furthermore, we encountered a multitude of problems with shipping and delivery. Our package arrived late, damaged, and missing parts, turning our experience into a nightmarish ordeal. Resolving the issue was an uphill battle, as the company displayed minimal concern for the inconvenience caused.Communication was consistently challenging throughout the entire ordeal. We were left in the dark, unsure when we would receive updates or find a resolution to our problems. This overwhelming frustration left us feeling undervalued as customers.Despite our efforts to escalate the matter and share our concerns with higher-level management, we received no meaningful response or resolution. It was disheartening to witness the company dismiss our feedback without consideration. One can't help but feel disappointed when a company easily overlooks its customers' concerns.",

It is riddled with numerous issues that make the journey a frustrating experience. The foremost problem is the consistent lateness of the vehicles, causing delays and inconveniences for passengers who depend on punctuality. Furthermore, the vehicles themselves are in a less than satisfactory condition, often dirty, poorly maintained, and uncomfortable, leading to an unpleasant travel experience.Moreover, the drivers lack professionalism and customer service skills, frequently displaying rudeness and a lack of helpfulness, showing little concern for passenger comfort or addressing their concerns. The overall communication and organization within the service are also severely lacking. Instances where routes were changed without any prior notice have left passengers confused and stranded.Additionally, the fares charged for this service are exorbitant considering the quality of service provided. It feels like passengers are paying a premium for a subpar experience. The limited alternative transportation options in Pittsburgh only compound the frustration, as commuters seeking a reliable and efficient way to navigate the city are left with few choices.Furthermore, the reliability of this transportation service leaves much to be desired. Breakdowns and service disruptions occur frequently, leading to additional delays and inconvenience for passengers. It is incredibly frustrating to be left waiting for extended periods without any updates or clear information on when the service will resume.",

During my upbringing, goulash was a beloved comfort food in our home, a hearty stew brimming with tender meat chunks, vegetables, and aromatic spices. Therefore, when I had the opportunity to sample goulash at a renowned Hungarian restaurant, I felt a mix of anticipation and apprehension, curious to see how it would measure up against my mother's homemade version.Upon the arrival of the steaming bowl of goulash, an alluring aroma immediately enveloped me, transporting me back to the kitchen of my childhood. The broth boasted a rich, reddish-brown hue, emanating a tantalizing fragrance that tickled my senses with its medley of paprika, caraway seeds, and other undisclosed spices. The meat chunks had been simmered to perfection, rendering them exceptionally tender and causing them to practically dissolve upon contact with my tongue.What truly distinguished this goulash from my mother's rendition was the remarkable depth of flavors it possessed. With each spoonful, a symphony of tastes unfolded before me, as the savory essence of the beef harmonized flawlessly with the sweet subtleties of caramelized onions and tomatoes. The paprika, an essential element in goulash, contributed a smoky undertone that elevated the dish to new culinary heights.The texture of the goulash was also exceptional. The vegetables, comprising chunks of potatoes and bell peppers, retained their firmness, providing a satisfying contrast to the tender meat. The broth boasted a velvety consistency that gracefully coated my palate, transforming each bite into a sumptuous indulgence.One surprising aspect was the choice of accompaniment. Instead of the customary side of noodles or bread, the goulash was furnished with fluffy dumplings. Initially, I approached this unconventional pairing with skepticism, but after taking a bite, I immediately grasped the brilliance behind it.",

The lack of hygiene standards was off-putting and raised concerns regarding the overall quality and safety of the food being served.Moreover, the prices were exorbitant for the subpar experience I endured. I had anticipated a higher level of service and food quality to justify the steep price tags, but unfortunately, that was not the case. Considering the overall lackluster experience, it felt like a complete rip-off.On a more positive note, I must acknowledge that the location boasted a charming ambiance. The decor exuded tastefulness, creating a cozy atmosphere that could have been a redeeming factor had the rest of the experience met expectations. However, aesthetic appeal alone cannot compensate for the myriad of shortcomings.",

Stepping through the doors, a wave of nostalgia washed over me as I took in the familiar blue and white color scheme, evoking childhood memories of shopping trips. However, as I delved deeper into the store, it became clear that Kmart was struggling to keep pace with the evolving times.What was once a bustling emporium now appeared deserted, with sparsely populated aisles and shelves showcasing a limited range of products. Kmart seemed to have lost its competitive edge, unable to match the convenience offered by online retailers and larger chain stores. Outdated displays and a cramped layout testified to the lack of modernization, making navigation through the cluttered sections a daunting task.The disinterested and uninspired demeanor of the staff further contributed to the lackluster shopping experience. Customer service was noticeably absent, leaving me feeling like just another anonymous shopper lost in the crowd.Despite these shortcomings, Kmart still boasted a modest following, as evidenced by a handful of customers browsing the aisles. The store did have its redeeming qualities, such as a commendable selection of reasonably priced home goods and discounted clothing items. Bargain hunters might still find some solace amidst the wide array of affordably priced products.One aspect that particularly caught my attention was the clearance section, where I stumbled upon impressive deals on discontinued items. However, the overall organization of the store made it challenging to locate specific items or find assistance when needed.As I approached the checkout counter, a hint of sadness washed over me. Kmart, once an iconic presence in American retail, had now become a faded relic of the past. Its decline mirrored the shifting landscape of the retail industry.",

The staff failed to take accurate measurements, resulting in a tuxedo that fit poorly and looked awkward and uncomfortable.To add insult to injury, the tuxedo they provided was dirty and adorned with noticeable stains.

The buttons were loose, and the seams were coming undone. It was an embarrassing spectacle that ruined the entire evening for me. I never anticipated a rental service to provide such substandard attire.Furthermore, the pricing they charged was exorbitant considering the abysmal quality they delivered. I could have obtained a far superior tuxedo from another establishment at a lower price. It is evident that this rental service capitalizes on its customers by charging exorbitant rates for subpar products.The customer service was equally horrendous.

It seemed like there was no consideration for creating a pleasant dined experience for patrons. Even the prices were exorbitant for the quality of nutrition and service provided. I couldn't help but 𝚏eel ripped off after paying such a hefty bill for such a subpar experience. It's infuriating to think that establiѕhments like this can get away with charging so much for so little.

The flavors were indeed as described in the premiere sentence: blah. Bland, unseasoned, and devoid of any discernible character, it left me longnig for a spark of creativity or passion. Each bite was a reminder of the missed opportunity to generating something truly remarkable. To add in sult to injury, the service was equally lackluster. The waitstaff went through the motions with a half-hearted attitude, displaying minimal interest in ensurng our dining enjoying was enjoyable. It's disheartenіng when even a simple request for a refill of water goes unanswered for far too long. The staff's indifference further contributed to the overall sens of mediocrity that permeated the establishment. As I looked around the restaurant, hoping for some redeeming qualities, li couldn't help but notification the lack of attention to detail. Shreds scattered on the floor, smudges on the windоws, and a general air of neglect left me questioning the level of care put into conserving the cleanliness of the place. It was evident that Atria'ѕ had fallen into a state of complacency. Perhaps the most diѕappointing aspect of my experience was the realization that nothing stood out as memorable. Atria's failed to leaѵe any lasting impression on my taste buds or my memory. It was as if I had stepped into a culinary void, where fl avor and creativity were replaced with a generic, forgettable mediocrity.",

I understand that the store is new and needs to make a profit, but some of the prices are just too much.

But then I saw that it was from my old friend, Sarah. We hadn't talked in a while, so I was excited to hear from her.We decided to meet at a new restaurant that had just opened up in town. When I got there, Sarah was already waiting for me. She looked great! She had lost some weight and her hair was longer. We hugged and caught up for a few minutes before we ordered our food.The food was delicious! We both had the salmon, which was cooked perfectly. We also shared a bottle of wine. It was so nice to spend time with Sarah again. We talked for hours about everything that had happened in our lives since we last saw each other.I'm so glad that I decided to meet up with Sarah. It was a great way to catch up with an old friend. I'm looking forward to seeing her again soon.In addition to the delicious food, the service at the restaurant was also excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed. He even brought us a complimentary dessert at the end of our meal.Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was relaxed and inviting. I would definitely recommend it to others.I will definitely be going back to this restaurant again soon. I'm already craving the salmon!I'm also looking forward to seeing Sarah again. We made plans to meet up for coffee next week.I'm so glad that I got that text message today. It led me to a great lunch with an old friend and a new favorite restaurant.I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious meal and great service. You won't be disappointed!",

The service is usually lacking as well, with the staff seeming more interested in talking to each other than taking care of the customers. The atmosphere is typically sterile and uninviting, with the same generic decor that you see at every other chain restaurant. It's no wonder that I always find myself disappointed when I eat at a chain restaurant.One of the worst experiences I had was at a chain Italian restaurant. The food was so bad that I could barely eat it, and the service was even worse. The waiter was rude and dismissive, and he seemed to be more interested in flirting with the other waitresses than taking care of our table. We ended up leaving before we even finished our meal, and I vowed never to eat at that restaurant again.Another time, I went to a chain Mexican restaurant with some friends. The food was bland and tasteless, and the service was just as bad. The waiter forgot our orders, and he took forever to bring us our food. When he finally did bring it, it was cold and soggy. We were all so disappointed that we didn't even bother to finish our meals.I've also had bad experiences at chain burger joints and chain pizza places. The food is always the same, and it's never very good. The service is usually just as bad, with the staff being more interested in talking to each other than taking care of the customers.I'm not saying that all chain restaurants are bad. I'm sure that there are some good ones out there. But in my experience, the majority of them are mediocre at best. If you're looking for a good meal, I would recommend avoiding chain restaurants and going to a local restaurant instead. You'll probably be much happier with the food and service.",

The only thing that kept me watching was the special effects, but even those were not that impressive.

This time, we're gonna be checking out a little hole-in-the-wall spot called \"The Greasy Spoon.\" Now, I know what you're all thinking: \"A greasy spoon? That doesn't sound very appetizing.\" But trust me, this place is a hidden gem.The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the friendly staff. They're always smiling and happy to make recommendations. And the menu is full of classic diner food, but everything is made with a little bit of a twist.For example, the burgers are made with a special blend of ground beef and chuck, and they're topped with a secret sauce that is to die for. And the fries are hand-cut and fried to perfection.But my favorite thing on the menu is the chicken fried steak. It's a huge piece of steak that's been battered and fried until it's golden brown and crispy. And it's smothered in a rich, creamy gravy.The prices are also very reasonable. You can get a burger and fries for under $10. And the chicken fried steak is only $12.So, if you're looking for a great place to get some good old-fashioned comfort food, then you need to check out The Greasy Spoon. You won't be disappointed.Overall, I give The Greasy Spoon a 5 out of 5 rating. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the prices are affordable. What more could you ask for?",

We ordered a lot of rolls (too many to count) and they were all very fresh and tasty. One thing I didn't like, however, was that every roll that included eel came with the bones. I don't mind bones in my fish when I'm eating sashimi or nigiri, but when I order a roll, I expect the bones to be removed. The fish used in the rolls were all super fresh and tasty, with the exception of the shrimp. The shrimp had a weird flavor to it that I couldn't quite place. It almost tasted like soap, which was really off-putting.All in all, I had a pretty positive experience at this restaurant. The food was fresh and tasty, and the service was good. The only thing that I didn't like was the shrimp, and I would probably just avoid ordering that in the future.Overall, I would say that this is a great place to get sushi.

We called again a few hours later and they sent someone up who fixed the TV but said he couldn't do anything about the hot water.

However, my most recent experiences have been nothing but negative. I purchased a pair of earrings and a necklace as a gift for my wife, and when I got them home, I realized that the earrings were the wrong size. I took them back to the store to exchange them, but they refused to do so because I didn't have the receipt. I explained that I had lost the receipt, but they said that they couldn't help me without it. I was very frustrated, as I had just spent a lot of money on these items and now I was stuck with a pair of earrings that my wife couldn't wear.To make matters worse, the necklace that I had purchased also broke within a few days of wearing it. The chain simply snapped, and the pendant fell off. I took it back to the store, and they said that they would send it to be repaired. However, it has been over a month now, and I have not heard back from them. I have called the store multiple times, but I always get the runaround. I am very disappointed with the quality of the jewelry that I purchased from Chalmers, and I am even more disappointed with their customer service. I will never shop there again.In addition to the issues that I have had with the jewelry itself, I have also been very disappointed with the customer service at Chalmers. The staff is rude and unhelpful, and they seem to be more interested in making a sale than in helping their customers.

I'm not sure if it was the altitude or the air quality, but something about the combination of the two made the beer taste even better than usual.Or maybe it was just the beer.The Perch is a small, unassuming brewpub located in the heart of downtown Flagstaff. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual, with a touch of rustic charm. The walls are adorned with beer-themed artwork, and the floors are covered in sawdust. The bar is stocked with a wide variety of local and regional beers, as well as a few national and international selections.I started with a flight of four of their most popular beers. The first was the Hefeweizen, which was light and refreshing with a slightly sweet finish. The second was the IPA, which was hoppy and bitter with a citrusy aroma. The third was the Stout, which was rich and creamy with a hint of chocolate. The fourth was the Barleywine, which was strong and complex with a deep malt flavor.Each beer was delicious and flavorful, and I could easily have had another flight. But I decided to pace myself, so I ordered a pint of the IPA to enjoy with my meal.For food, I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was lightly battered and fried to perfection, and the chips were crispy and golden brown. The tartar sauce was homemade and delicious.The combination of the beer and the food was heavenly. I savored every bite and sip, and I left The Perch feeling happy and content.If you're ever in Flagstaff, I highly recommend checking out The Perch.

I was supposed to be on the 6:00 p.m. flight from Philadelphia to Orlando, but my flight from Boston to Philadelphia was delayed for over two hours. By the time I finally got to Philadelphia, my connecting flight had already left. I was stuck in the airport for over four hours until the next flight to Orlando.I was really frustrated and disappointed with USAirways. They didn't seem to care at all that I had missed my flight. They didn't offer me any compensation or even an apology. I will never fly with them again.I ended up spending over $400 on a last-minute ticket on another airline. I also had to pay for a hotel room in Philadelphia. I was supposed to be home by 9:00 p.m., but I didn't get back to Florida until after midnight.I'm still really upset about the whole experience. I feel like USAirways really let me down. I'm not sure if I'll ever fly again.I know that things happen, but it's how the airline handles the situation that matters. USAirways did not handle this situation well at all. They were rude, unhelpful, and uncaring. I would not recommend them to anyone.If you're flying, do yourself a favor and choose another airline. USAirways is the worst.I'm not the only one who has had a bad experience with USAirways. There are hundreds of complaints online about their delays, lost luggage, and poor customer service.I hope that USAirways will learn from their mistakes and improve their customer service. In the meantime, I will never fly with them again.",

The staff is always friendly and helpful, and they've always been quick to resolve any issues I've had. I've also been really happy with the rates on my loans and credit cards.However, there were a few things that I didn't like about Summit Credit Union. First, their online banking platform is a bit outdated. It's not as user-friendly as some of the other credit unions I've used. Second, their fees can be a bit high. For example, they charge a $25 fee to close a savings account.Overall, I've been happy with my experience with Summit Credit Union. They're a solid choice for anyone looking for a credit union.Here are some specific examples of the excellent customer service I've received from Summit Credit Union:* A few years ago, I was in a car accident and needed to get a loan to cover the repairs. Summit Credit Union was able to approve my loan quickly and easily. They also gave me a great interest rate.* Last year, I was looking to buy a house. Summit Credit Union was able to pre-approve me for a mortgage within a few days. This made the home-buying process much easier.* I've also had a few instances where I've needed to contact customer service for help.

        "text": "**Very good.** In my opinion, the best thing on the menu. It’s rigatoni pasta in a creamy vodka sauce, topped with sautéed sundried tomatoes and grilled chicken. It may sound a little crazy, but it totally works. The flavors blend perfectly together. I always ask for extra sauce because it is insanely delicious and I want to savor every last drop. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and the sundried tomatoes add a nice tangy flavor to the creamy, rich sauce. I would say this dish is definitely a must-try, especially if you are a fan of creamy pasta dishes. Plus, the portion size is huge so you will definitely get your money’s worth.The service here is always top-notch, but on my last visit, the server took a little long to get to our table. They seemed a little scattered, but the food made up for any small hiccups.Overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, the service is usually great, and the food is always delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.Price: $12.50Rating: 5/5",

My husband's steak was overcooked and tough, and my daughter's chicken fingers were dry and tasteless.To make matters worse, the place was filthy. The carpet was stained and the tables were sticky.

I ended up going with the most expensive one because I figured you get what you pay for. But I could not have been more wrong! I made an appointment for the next day to get it installed so that I didn't have to wait around for them to get to it. When I came back the next day I was seated right away, no wait. That was nice, but it all went downhill from there. She washed my hair, put it in a towel and left me sitting there for nearly an hour. I finally asked the woman at the front desk if she knew how much longer it would be. She went and got the lady that was doing my hair and she seemed annoyed that I had asked.She took me back to the chair and began cutting my hair without even asking me how I wanted it cut or even looking at the picture I had brought in. I told her that I wanted layers, but to keep it long. She assured me that she knew what she was doing. She also assured me that she had cut hair before! She cut off a huge chunk in the front and then said 'Oops!'. She then said she would blend it in. When she was done, I looked like a poodle that had been attacked by a lawnmower! Nothing was blended, it just did not make any sense and nothing about it was good. She kept trying to defend why she did the haircut and why it looked good. She offered to fix it but at that point I was ready to run away crying!I went back a couple of weeks later to have it fixed by a different stylist. She was very kind and listened to what I wanted. She was completely upset to see what had been done to my hair. She fixed it the best that she could and said that it would take a few months to grow out enough to fix it properly. I had to wear my hair in a ponytail for months waiting for it to grow out. I am never ever going back to that place again!",

My husband raved about his steak, saying it was one of the best he'd ever had.For dessert, we couldn't resist trying the chocolate peanut butter pie.

This museum was very educational and gave us a better understanding of the struggles that slaves faced during the 19th century. We spent the whole day there and still didn’t see everything. After that, we went to the Newport Aquarium. This place was a lot of fun! It was a sobering experience, but it’s important to remember these things so that they don’t happen again. Next, we went to the Cincinnati Art Museum. We saw all kinds of aquatic life, including sharks, rays, and jellyfish. We even got to touch a stingray! We also visited the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal. This museum has a wide variety of art, from ancient to modern. We spent a few hours wandering through the galleries, and we saw some amazing pieces. We spent our last day in town at the Great American Ball Park. This museum is located in a beautiful old train station, and it has a lot of exhibits on science, history, and culture. We learned a lot about the history of Cincinnati and the surrounding area, and we had a great time exploring the museum. We had a great time on our road trip to Cincinnati.

I can't complain about anything except the shrimp. I wouldn't order that again. The orange chicken was good. The cashew chicken was bland. The rice was fine. It wasn't dry, but it wasn't too wet either. The egg roll was average. The wonton soup was good. For a fast-food Chinese restaurant, this place isn't bad. I'd probably eat here again, as long as I didn't get the shrimp.",

However, it has been downhill in recent years. Nowadays, most of the stores are empty, and the shopping mall is dirty and dilapidated. It is a pity to see what happened to this shopping mall. The decline of the Islamic Shopping Center reflects the decline of the entire Charlotte. The city has been losing its population and enterprise for many years, and it has become increasingly difficult to find a job or make a living here. The shopping mall is just another victim of the city's decline. This is a tragic day, a once tedious shopping center was forced to close. This shows that the city is troublesome. I hope Charlotte can reverse the situation, but this will require a lot of work. At the same time, I must find a new shopping place. I'm not sure where I will go, but I know this will not be the Istram Shopping Center. The decline in shopping malls also reflects the changing retail pattern. More and more people are shopping online, and traditional physical stores are working hard to compete. This is especially true for shopping centers that are usually regarded as outdated and inconvenient. The future of Islamic Shopping Center is uncertain. It can be re -developed into other things, or it can be simply demolished. No matter what happens, this is a sad day for Charlotte. The shopping mall is a place for the community, and many people miss it. I hope that the city can find a way to revitalize the area and create a new community consciousness. At the same time, I will remember what the Eastland Mall was once: a booming shopping mall is part of Charlotte fabric. The decline of the shopping mall reminds people that nothing can continue forever. Even the most successful companies may be in trouble. The important thing is to appreciate what we have, because it may disappear tomorrow. I'm not sure what the future of the Eastland Shopping Center, but I hope it can find new purposes.",

The movie jumps all over the locations, and it's never clear what's actually going on.

Our server, who never introduced herself, took over 20 minutes to take our drank order after we were seated. When she finally did come to our table, she was incredibly rude and pejorative. She acted like she couldn't be bothered to be there and made it clear that she didn't caⲅe about our experimentation. After we finally got our drinks, it were anоther 30 minutes for her to come back to take our food order. When the food did arrive, it was cold and cⅼearly had been si𝚝ting under a heat lamp for a while. The server never cmae back to check on uѕ or refill our drinks, and when we tried to get her attention, she ignored us. Finally, after we had been there for over 2 hours, we just asked for the chck and left. I will never be goіng back to this location again and would advise anyone else to aoid it as well. Te service is absolutely terrible and the food is not worth the hassle. If you are looking for a buena dining experience, I suggest you look elsewhere.

I decided to try their shrimp tempura ramen for my first visit. The noodles were perfectly al dente and the broth was rich and flavorful. There was a generous portion of shrimp tempura alongside the noodles that added a nice crunch. I will definitely be back to sample other varieties on their menu like the miso ramen and tsukemen. The interior was kept simple yet stylish with a long counter wrapped around an open kitchen. It was nice to watch the chefs hard at work preparing fresh bowls of ramen. There seemed to always be a wait for a seat at the counter but it moved quickly. Prices are very reasonable for the large servings you get. Service from the friendly staff was also efficient. In addition to ramen, they had other appetizers and sides like gyoza, karaage, and braised pork buns that looked too tempting to pass up for another visit. The space isn't huge but they utilize every inch well and have a nice flow. I overheard other customers raving about bowls they had tried on previous visits. It's clear this place has quickly become a local favorite for good reason.It's a convenient spot whether you want a quick lunch or leisurely dinner. Next time I think I'll try sitting at the counter if possible for the full experience.

We started by exploring some of the new restaurants that had opened up in our neighborhood over the past year. The first place we stopped at looked promising but they were already booked up for the night. Not wanting to go too far, we walked a few blocks over to a casual Italian spot called Bruschetta Bakery. The aromas hitting our noses as we walked in smelled absolutely divine. We were seated right away at a cozy corner table. We started with some fresh bread and olive oil for dipping which hit the spot. For dinner, I got the lasagna bolognese which was rich and hearty. My husband ordered the chicken parmigiana and raved about how flavorful it was. We split a bottle of chianti that paired nicely with our meals. The restaurant wasn't too crowded for a weeknight which made for a relaxing vibe. After we finished eating, we sat chatting with our wine for another thirty minutes or so. It was such a pleasant change to be out on a nice evening instead of bundled up inside. Feeling stuffed, we paid our bill and waddled back outside into the cool air. On our walk home, we passed by the neighborhood park and noticed quite a few people still hanging around enjoying the weather. It had us wishing we lived in a warmer place where evenings like this were more common in the winter months. Once home, we curled up on the couch feeling content with our little dinner date night adventure. Even on busy work nights, it's nice to make time to get out and enjoy simple pleasures together. The unseasonable warm weather had certainly made our experience all the more enjoyable.",

Even the bathroom was immaculate with no messes or lingering odors. Staff members could be seen sanitizing doors, tables and chairs regularly. The food preparation areas were also kept in great condition. All equipment and work surfaces shone as if they had just been scrubbed. Employees handling food wore gloves and hairnets or hats. Fresh vegetables and ingredients were stored properly in the refrigerator and pantry. No expired items remained on the shelves. Garbage and compost bins were emptied frequently.Customer areas saw a high turnover of cleaning too. I never spotted so much as a stray napkin or piece of trash on the floor over my hour-long stay. Each table was cleaned and disinfected between seatings. Menus were laminated for easy sanitizing between uses. Condiments came in individual single-use packages or sanitizing stations. Staff members went out of their way to provide an extremely clean dining experience. When I asked a manager about their sanitation procedures, he was proud to share their meticulous checklist and logs confirming tasks were done on schedule. It was clear maintaining high sanitation standards was a top priority for the ownership and management.

The tavern had a laidback atmosphere with worn booths and bartenders who had clearly been there for years. A long wooden bar took up much of the space, with baseball caps and menus tucked along the edge. We ordered drinks and snacks as we chatted about our week and upcoming weekend plans. The menu looked like typical pub fare - wings, burgers, tacos and nachos. Our order arrived quickly as the bar wasn't too busy in the early evening. We dug into our food which was tasty and reasonably priced for Uptown. More customers started filtering in as it neared dinner time and more games came on the TVs. The bar buzz was lively but not overly loud, providing a nice ambient noise. We lingered over our second round of beers, in no rush to leave the comfortable confines of Dixie's.

My entree of salmon was bland and overcooked, falling apart on the plate. The sides were sparse and did little to complement the main dish. To make matters worse, the service was spotty at best. It took ages for our drinks to be refilled and we had to flag down our server multiple times. By the time our check came, we were more than ready to leave. I tried to be optimistic and give Mert's a fair shot, but in the end it just wasn't a pleasing dining experience. The menu looked intriguing on paper, but the execution in the kitchen clearly needs refinement. I know Mert is still getting the hang of owning a restaurant rather than just being the chef. With some improvements to both food and service, I'd consider giving Mert's another try down the road. For now though, I can't recommend dining there until things are tightened up.",

The reps try their best but frequently do not have the knowledge or tools to truly resolve issues. We have endured multiple dropped connections, buffering, and no picture problems over the years. Every call seems to result in a suggested reboot or factory reset, which only provides temporary relief. Upgrades to equipment have sometimes made the problems worse instead of better. Billing mistakes are all too common, leading to higher charges or suspended service until matters can be straightened out. The DVR functionality leaves much to be desired, with frequent glitches in recording or playing back shows. Switching to UVerse was a mistake as our previous cable internet was much more reliable. At this point, we are anxiously awaiting the arrival of reliable fiber optic service to switch providers. If our only choice was to stay with UVerse, I would downgrade to a slower speed to avoid dependance on their mercurial television offerings.

Our server Giovanni was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He recommended the chicken parmesan which he assured would change my mind about Italian. I was skeptical but decided to trust his recommendation. The chicken arrived and it was truly delicious, cooked to perfection with melted mozzarella and rich tomato sauce. The pasta dishes also looked wonderful, with hearty portions of linguini and fettuccine. The bruschetta appetizer we tried was simple but fresh with ripe tomatoes and basil. Seeing others enjoy classic dishes like lasagne and pizza made me realize I had been missing out. The tiramisu for dessert took me back to Italy in every bite of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone cream. I left very full and satisfied that night, surprised that Italian food could be so flavorful. From that meal on, I started to become more adventurous trying new restaurants and dishes. Mario's will definitely remain one of my favorite places to get traditional, homemade Italian cooking.

Performance is zippy and responsive with no noticeable lag anywhere in the interface or during regular everyday tasks. Gaming performance is also strong for most types of games.

Overall performance remains strong over time without slow down. Compatibility with headphones, chargers, and cases from previous models in this lineup help retain value for current owners and potential upgraders.

The exhilaration of racing around the track is always a thrill, even for casual participants like myself. Zipping around corners and accelerating down the long straightaways results in a rush of adrenaline and a smile that's hard to wipe off your face. However, it's important to remember that go-karting is still a motor sport, which means safety should always be the top priority. Slowing down appropriately for turns and being mindful of your surroundings is key to avoiding accidents that could spoil an enjoyable outing. The staff at this particular go-kart facility did an excellent job providing a thorough safety briefing before we hit the track. They emphasized the rules of conduct and highlighted hazard areas to help ensure everyone could have fun while also staying safe. The karts themselves seemed well-maintained and in good working order. Controls like the wheel, pedals and harness all felt sturdy.As with any motorized activity, there is an inherent risk that can't be eliminated. But this facility worked to minimize the risks as much as possible through their preparation and oversight. Once the green flag waved and our session began, it was simply exhilarating to open up the throttle and race around the circuit. Carving through esses and sling-shotting out of turns produced an adrenaline surge like no other. While beginners should take it easy at first, experienced drivers can really push the limits and feel the rush of competition. Before I knew it, the checkered flag was waving to end our time on track. My cheeks hurt from all the grinning and my arms felt the fatigue of wrestling the go-kart around such a technical layout.

The menu has a nice variety of specialty pies along with build-your-own options to fully customize. Drink selections include beer, wine and specialty cocktails that creatively highlight seasonal ingredients. Prices are reasonable given the level of artistry and care put into every aspect of the operation. Payment processes are simple and efficient. Customer service remains top-notch whether interacting in-person or over the phone for delivery or pickup orders. It's clear why Price's has become such a neighborhood gem and staple for many locals. The family-owned business pours their heart into the pizza, drinks and dining experience night after night. It's no wonder they have a loyal customer base that keeps coming back year after year. The quality and care shines through in everything they do.",

The park pays homage to the art of Romare Bearden, featuring several large murals depicting his collage work. My father-in-law seemed especially interested in learning more about Bearden's innovative artistic style. We spent a few hours walking along the trails, taking in all the vibrant colors and detailed scenes painted across the walls. The kids really enjoyed searching for all the hidden objects and figures within each piece. It was fascinating to observe Bearden's ability to incorporate so many diverse materials and textures into his collages. After making our way around the park, we stopped to have a picnic lunch in the grassy area shaded by large oak trees. On the ride back home, my mother-in-law couldn't stop commenting on how much she appreciated experiencing the park and being introduced to a famous local artist. It was nice to spend quality time with family at this new addition to our city. I'm glad we made the effort to check out Romare Bearden Park during their visit.",

The friendly host sat us right away at a corner table near the front window. We started by splitting an order of the fried pickles which were crunchy and had a nice garlic aioli for dipping. I got the BBQ pork sandwich that was piled high with pulled pork, coleslaw and barbecue sauce on a brioche bun. My friend had the Reuben which was cooked perfectly with warm sauerkraut and Russian dressing. The flavors in both sandwiches were bold and delicious. We found it hard to choose between the variety of thick milkshakes they offered. I opted for the Oreo cookie shake that was incredibly rich and creamy. They also had an impressive selection of craft beers on tap. After we finished our meals, we decided we had to try a slice of pie for dessert. They had several flavors made fresh daily and we chose the coconut cream. It was light and fluffy with a tasty coconut custard filling. Our server was very friendly and gave us recommendations for other things to see and do in Charlotte.

The server was terse and rude when we pointed out the errors, seeming more interested in chatting with the kitchen staff than helping customers. We had to wait even longer just to get our incorrect items remade. The restaurant was crowded but many tables had clearly been waiting much too long to even place their orders. The facility was in need of repairs and updating throughout as well. Dirty dishes and trash littered areas where customers had to walk. Music was blaring at an uncomfortable volume making conversation difficult. Overall the ambiance was not at all relaxing or pleasant for a dining experience. I would not consider returning or recommending this establishment to anyone looking for a good meal out. Especially for the higher than average prices they were charging, the quality of food and service simply did not match up. Most disappointing was that simple things like getting an order right, providing timely bills, and greeting customers with courtesy seemed beyond their capabilities on the night we dined. Basic customer service standards were clearly not being enforced or followed by management. It's unclear how this location has maintained its doors in business for as long as it has with such a subpar performance.

In addition to the fondue, salads and desserts are also included in the price which adds incredible value. Our server is also excellent at refilling drinks without our having to ask. At the end, we feel completely satisfied but not overstuffed. It's a very social and fun experience to share with family or friends.

The restaurant has a nice cozy atmosphere with red checkered tablecloths and paintings of Italian landscapes on the walls.

Overall Phoenix Sky Harbor is decently sized and functional for its role serving the Phoenix metropolitan area. The terminals are spaced out which requires a bit of walking but signage is usually adequate to find your way. Food options have improved in recent years with more sit down restaurants added beyond just fast food. Security lines usually move fairly quickly though the TSA pre-check or clear lanes are worth it if you travel often. The gates are spaced out at the end of the long terminals which requires more walking once you're past security. Drop-off and pickups can be challenging due to traffic but the cell phone waiting lots help alleviate congestion. Wayfinding in the parking garages takes some practice to find your designated floor and row. Flight schedules are usually on time with few cancellations or delays. The Phoenix area freeways provide adequate access though traffic during peak hours can mean longer drives to and from the airport. Rental car facilities are spread out so confirm which location you need to go to avoid wasting time. Overall the airport serves its purpose for most travelers even if some aspects could still use improvements.

The restaurant was starting to fill up but it wasn't too crowded yet. Our server came over promptly to take our drink order. I ordered an IPA and my friend got a seasonal cocktail. For an appetizer we decided to share the bruschetta. It came out quickly and the bread was toasted to perfection with a nice mixture of veggies and olive oil on top. We made quick work of it while deciding on our entrees. I went with the flatbread pizza since I'm a sucker for anything with goat cheese. My friend got the burger since she said it's one of the best around. When our food came out it looked delicious. I dove right into my pizza which had a nice crispy crust and fresh toppings. The goat cheese added a nice creaminess. My friend agreed her burger was wonderfully cooked and packed full of flavor. We were both thoroughly enjoying our meals. As we chatted and ate the restaurant gradually got busier around us. It was noticeable how well run everything seemed. Our server checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything else. By the time we finished our plates we were both pretty full and satisfied. We decided to skip dessert for now but did each order an after dinner drink. Those went down smoothly as wepeople watched from our cozy booth. It was starting to get dark out by then so we debated sticking around for the whole evening or calling it a day. In the end we paid our check and made our way out, glad we stopped by for a casual yet quality meal.",

It was just a few blocks from the main attractions and within walking distance of shops and restaurants. The staff was extremely helpful with recommendations on things to see and do in the local area. Check-in was quick and efficient. My room was spacious and spotless. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were high-quality. I appreciated the mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room. Wifi was fast and reliable throughout the hotel. The indoor pool and fitness center were a nice bonus. It was great to be able to unwind with a swim after a long day of sightseeing. There was also a business center for any work needs. Both the indoor and outdoor common areas were pleasant spaces to relax or get work done. Breakfast included a wide selection of hot and cold items, from freshly baked pastries to healthy fruits and yogurts. Portions were generous.Prices at the hotel restaurant and bar were quite reasonable considering the location. Food and drink quality was very good. Multiple seating areas meant you could dine inside or out depending on weather and mood. What really stood out was how attentive and friendly all the staff members were. They went out of their way to ensure guests had an excellent experience. While some hotels in the city charge high nightly rates, I felt this one offered top-notch value. The combination of amenities, comfort, service and location at a competitive price made me glad I chose it. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town and would recommend it to others traveling on both business and leisure. It delivered everything travelers need for a convenient and pleasant visit.",

While we waited, I browsed the menu and saw all the pizza, pasta and appetizer options. I was most excited to try their famous deep dish pizza. About 10 minutes later, our wait was over and we were seated at a nice table by the window. Our server Emma came by right away to drop off water and breadsticks. She was friendly and knowledgeable about all the menu items. We started with an order of spinach and artichoke dip to share for the table. It came out piping hot and was the perfect combination of creamy and flavorful. For our main dishes, we each ordered a different pizza to try slices of everything. The crust on the deep dish pizza was thick and buttery. It was filled to the brim with melted cheese, sausage and pepperoni. I savored every cheesy, saucy bite. We polished off our pizzas with no leftovers to take home. To finish, we split a order of lava cakes for dessert. They were the perfect sweet and decadent ending to our meal. Our server brought the check promptly and wished us a good night. Based on our delightful experience, Uno Chicago Grill has certainly won us over as new loyal customers.

I decided to start with the edamame and a green tea. The edamame was perfectly cooked still in their pods.

The eel was melt in your mouth tender and the rice was fluffy and not sticky. My friend had the chicken katsu curry which looked rich and comforting. We also ordered the agedashi tofu to share as an appetizer. The tofu was light and crispy on the outside while creamy inside. It was served with a tasty bonito flavored broth. For dessert, I couldn't resist trying the green tea mochi ice cream balls. The ice cream had a lovely subtle green tea flavor wrapped in a chewy rice cake. The entire meal wassimply delicious and represented Japanese home cooking perfectly. The waitress was patient and kind as we struggled slightly with the Japanese menu.

The servers had to navigate the tight quarters efficiently to deliver meals and refills without getting in each other's way. Most of my coworkers were college students or recent grads like myself just looking for part-time work. The managers worked long hours to keep everything running smoothly during the rushes. At the end of each shift, we were all exhausted but felt good that we satisfied so many patrons. It was rewarding to see customers enjoying their meals and coming back time and time again.

Some of the older monuments and mausoleums are truly works of art and it's interesting to glimpse into the lives of those now gone. While it may seem unusual, I find graveyards calming places of solitude in the busy city. We often share the grounds with other early morning or evening walkers also seeking respite from the bustle of daily life. In warmer months, the shade provided by mature trees offers a pleasant escape from the sun. I especially enjoy visiting around autumn when changing leaves add splashes of color and crunch underfoot.

On nice summer evenings when it's balmy out, I like to bring my lawn chair down and just watch the duck show while sipping an iced tea.

The neighbors must think I'm plain loony, coming down here by my lonesome just to stare at some plastic ducks. But what can I say - there's just something about the simple fun of it that does me good. It's like my batteries are bursting full after soaking in all that goofy lightheartedness. Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to it. You should give ol' Fake Duck Pond a visit sometime too - I promise it'll put a smile on your face.",

I always dreaded coming but they said it was important for \"getting face time\" with clients. The food was usually pretty good but it could get boring listening to all the shop talk over dinner. One time my boss Wayne got so drunk he started singing show tunes at the top of his lungs, it was hilarious! The other customers and staff definitely didn't know what to make of that scene. After that things seemed to relax a bit more and we'd actually enjoy ourselves. I really got to know some of the regulars who were always in and they'd joke around with me too. A few years back they did a big renovation and expansion so it feels totally refreshed in here now. The new bar area is perfect for unwinding after a long day. I've even started bringing friends here on weekends because the atmosphere is so lively. This place really hit all the marks for good food and drinks in a comfortable setting - my bosses had the right idea dragging me here after all!",

If I was going to take anybody here, it would have to be my next door neighbor because everyone else I know has better things to do on a Saturday night. The music they were playing was this weird mellow acoustic stuff that just made me want to fall asleep in my salad. I actually caught myself nodding off a couple times before I started drinking my third cup of coffee. Thank god the waitress had a great sense of humor because otherwise this place would be torture. She was dropping some hilarious quips to try and entertain me since no one else was around. At one point I swear I heard her quietly singing \"rescue me\" under her breath when she walked by my table. The food was fine I guess, nothing special but it didn't make me want to scream either which is really all you can ask for in a situation like this. I think I'm going to have to give this place a few more tries on different nights before I fully write it off though, there's still a chance it could be slightly less dead next time.

The place has not changed much since I was last here, still with the same colorful decor and window seats. Funny, I have never taken a date here yet but it seems like a really romantic spot on a busy night. We got there around 7 which I thought would avoid the crowds but boy was I wrong, the place was packed! After waiting about 15 minutes for a table, we finally got seated but unfortunately not by the windows. No problem though, it gave me a chance to people watch all the busy servers rushing around. Our server was super friendly and explained all the different eating methods which I always find fascinating. We started with some vegetarian combo appetizers to share which were delicious as always. Then went all out ordering lamb, chicken and beef entrees. I seriously don't know how they stay so slim eating with their hands all the time. The injera bread is just magical for soaking up all the fantastic sauces. As if that wasn't enough, my friend and I just had to get a dessert to share. The honey cake with gelato was to die for! I'm sure I looked like a mess by the end but who cares when the food is this pricey and flavorful. Service was excellent despite how busy they were. Overall another great experience at Red Sea. Value, service and desserts here is better than the other two Ethiopian spots I've tried. Definitely recommend if you want to experience something new and fun.

When I walked in I was greeted by the owner Jose who has run this place for over 20 years. He has one of those big bright smiles that instantly puts you at ease. The dining room is small but clean with booths covered in faded blue vinyl. You might even spot a regular or two seated at the counter swapping stories with Jose. We started with the chips and salsa which was surprisingly good. The salsa had a nice kick without being overpowering and the chips were fresh and crispy. For my meal I got the fajita taco plate knowing it was a safe bet. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor in each bite. The chicken was marinated to perfection, nicely charred around the edges. The peppers and onions were caramelized to bring out their natural sweetness. The flour tortillas were warm and pliable, just holding together until I took my last bite. My friend got daring and tried the chiles rellenos which she said were freaking awesome. The poblano peppers were stuffed with queso Oaxaca then fried to a light crispy outer layer. She said the blend of flavors and textures in each bite was to die for. By the time we finished, we were both pleasantly stuffed. Jose insisted we save room for the flan for dessert so of course we did. Light as air with just the right bite of cinnamon, it hit the spot perfectly. While nothing fancy, this place gets my vote for best value meal in town. The friendly atmosphere and authentic tastes make it a local gem worth checking out next time you're in the neighborhood.",

I'm usually not a big fan of collard greens but these have got me rethinkin' that...they flavor them up with plenty of spice and bacon - how can you go wrong?!  The mac n cheese is like nothing I've had before. Instead of the powdered stuff, it's made with three different kinds of cheese and is insanely creamy and rich. Seriously, I may have licked the bowl clean...probs not the classiest move but I have no regrets!They've also got some items I've never seen on a soul food menu before. Like this shrimp and grits that was outta this world. The shrimp were plump and buttery and the grits were smooth and cheesy - such a good combo. There was also this charred brussels sprouts dish that had me shovelin' them in like they were chips or somethin!Anywho, the servers were super friendly and quick to refill my sweet tea. The vibe inside is warm and inviting too. Overall, I'm totally impressed with how they elevated all my fave dishes. Def gonna have to head back real soon and try some other items.

You kinda need the fast pass things to run the dinner there I think. Also it rains like every day in the summer apparently cause we got poured on halfway through. At least they had places to hide from the rain I guess, that was probly the worst part. Other than that it was a fun day even if my knees were killin me after all the rides.

We started with a serving of piping hot naan to share that had a perfect balance of chewiness and softness. It was the ideal vehicle to scoop up the flavors of the chickpea curry alongside. Speaking of curries, the palak paneer was superb - the spinach blended seamlessly with the soft cubes of paneer. My husband decided to try something different and ordered the tandoori chicken. The tender morsels of chicken were nicely charred on the outside while still moist inside. It came with those addictive sauces that you just want to dip everything into. I stuck with what I know and love - the lamb vindaloo. True to style, it packed quite the punch with an abundance of garam masala but stopped short of being overwhelmingly hot.  We had hoped to save room for dessert but our mains were so satisfying that we reluctantly admitted defeat. A mango lassi did help refresh our palates though.

Overall the show was cool but definitely won't be back if it's gonna be that crazy crowded again.",

The friendly host sat us right away at a corner table by the front window. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which was piled high with pulled pork, slaw and bbq sauce on a brioche bun. My friend had the Reuben, which was cooked to perfection with warm sauerkraut and Russian dressing. Both sandwiches were delicious and full of flavor. They also had a nice selection of craft beers on tap. We had a hard time choosing between the many thick milkshakes. I finally decided on the Oreo cookie shake, which was incredibly rich and creamy. They had several pies made fresh daily, and we chose the coconut cream, which was light and fluffy with a tasty coconut custard filling. After we finished our meal, we decided to try a slice of pie for dessert. Our friendly waitress gave us some tips on what to do in Charlotte. This local gem is a great place to stop for lunch or dinner if you're visiting Charlotte. I would definitely return here the next time I'm in the area, based on the quality of the food and the friendly service.",

This May she will graduate from the fifth grade and go to middle school in a new borough. I know this is a big change and transition for her and she will probably be nervous. However, she seems excited to explore new teachers, classes and peers. I hope she will be able to maintain some of her friendships from elementary school during this transition.

They seem to think that quality and customer service are just a matter of course. No one feels able to take a proper holiday for fear that their job will not be there when they return.

The micro-management of staff has reached absurd proportions. Trust and autonomy have been replaced by control and supervision. The place feels more like a pressure cooker than a place where people want to work. The best people are leaving in droves, which makes things even worse as valuable experience and knowledge goes with them. Those who are still there are only there because they can’t find anything better or are just counting the days until they can retire.

Some of the action scenes had me on the edge of my seat with my heart pounding. All the characters, both good and bad, were so well developed that I was interested in how their individual stories would end. The setting also comes alive vividly through rich descriptions that put me right there with the characters.

In the first few minutes I was already squirming with discomfort, hoping it would get better, but knowing in my heart that it would only get worse. The characters were one-dimensional idiots who seemed to exist only to be killed off in increasingly graphic ways. What started as an interesting premise about a family moving into a haunted house quickly degenerated into a gruesome torture pornography. Jump scares and gore were used as cheap substitutes for real scares and storytelling. Plot holes and illogical situations abounded. The characters did stupid things just to prolong their suffering and increase the body count. No attempt was made to make them sympathetic or to give us a reason to care about their fate. I usually enjoy horror movies and can suspend disbelief, but this one was torture. There was no artistry, only misery, and it was all done to elicit a reaction of disgust. The climax was a messy, drawn-out bloodbath that left me numb. Don't make the mistake of spending your time and money on this joyless mess.

Extensive, multi-course menus give way to a streamlined, simplified menu with limited choices. Quality is sacrificed to some extent, as ingredients, cooking times and plating are scaled back. For diners, the experience lacks the leisurely pace and personal touch of a regular night out. Waiters and chefs are rushed to accommodate double or triple the usual number of diners in a shortened time. Each reservation feels like an assembly line, with little room for error. Exhausted staff feel more like cogs in a machine than culinary artists. And disgruntled customers who complain on Yelp or Twitter about long waits or rushed service can damage a restaurant’s reputation. On the other hand, the marketing boost and revenue from all the extra covers is hard to pass up. With careful planning of menus, staffing and logistics, some restaurants manage to navigate Restaurant Week with minimal compromises.

By the time someone comes to the table to ask about food, my colleagues and I only have 20 minutes left for our break. The poor service has definitely cut into our valuable break time on more than one occasion. On top of that, the waiters are hurried and irritated, as if they were in a hurry to get everyone out the door as soon as possible. It's really annoying as a customer to feel rushed when you're trying to relax on your short break. I hope the owners are aware of these consistent service problems at lunch and are working to improve the experience. I've recommended Aquavina to friends and family in the past for its delicious dishes, but I always warn them about the slow lunch service before they make a reservation. The good food is not worth the hassle if you're trying to enjoy a leisurely lunch. With a few adjustments to staffing or training, I'm sure they could provide a much more pleasant lunch experience worthy of the restaurant's quality cuisine. It would be a shame if potential new customers were discouraged from dining here because of poor reviews about the speed of service during the busy lunch hour. Until then, I'll be eating elsewhere.",

The characters are so well developed and three dimensional. The triumphs were so joyous and the trials so heartbreaking. I laughed and I cried, this book took me through the whole gamut of emotions. The plot kept me guessing with its many twists and turns. I didn't see some of the major revelations coming at all. This is definitely one of the best books I've read all year. The writing and storytelling are absolutely top notch. I will definitely be recommending it to all my friends. It's a book that will stay with me for a long time.

There are no distracting HUD elements, so you are always completely immersed. This game should be experienced by anyone who wants more than just mindless action and shooting in modern games.

The exhibition can use some updates because many people feel outdated and unwavering. There are not enough explanations or contexts in many of the projects displayed. I walked away and didn't feel that I had learned a lot or engagement there. Although there is a large space, some rooms still feel empty and useless. The outdoor part of the attraction has greater potential, but still feels half of the completion and lacks a lot of visible or done things. Employees are very friendly, but they seem to have little enthusiasm or knowledge about the exhibition. According to other similar attractions I have visited, the price you get is too high. I only spent about an hour wandering, and then used everything to see and do. It requires more hands -on activities and interactive elements to attract families and young tourists. Some refurbishment and other exhibitions can help it understand and provide a more fulfilling experience. Through some improvements, it may become a valuable cultural destination, but it is currently feeling like an opportunity to miss. I doubt whether I suggest you visit, unless you have made major changes to make it out of an outing all day. In the current state, it lacks vision and attention to visitors' experience.",

The crowds were immense, frequently making it difficult to access rides in a timely manner. Additionally, the pervasive loud noises and flashy visuals exacerbated the sensory overload. After a few tiring hours experiencing constant stimulation, I started feeling exhausted. That said, the rides themselves were impressive technical achievements providing thrills and entertainment. My favorite was the newest rollercoaster, thrilling riders along an exciting course at high speeds. The attention to detail bringing the intellectual property to life was also admirable across the different sections. However, it was challenging to fully appreciate these aspects among the massive volume of visitors.I opted to return at another time early in the morning to avoid peak crowds.

From the moment the curtain rose, it was clear this production had abandoned any intention of presenting a conventional theatrical experience. Oddball costumes and erratic stage design seemingly plucked straight from a carnival relentlessly bombarded the senses at every turn. Whatever faint story could be discerned took a back seat to spontaneous acts of absurdism flooding the stage. Performers engaged in confrontational antics with audience members that challenged standards of public decency. Just when it seemed the madness could go no further, a new low was plumbed. Animals were brought on stage under dubious conditions, exacerbating the increasingly unsettling atmosphere. Meaning appeared to be purposefully obscured in a barrage of sensory overload and disregard for the audience's peace of mind. It proved a challenge to discern where authentic artistry ended and gratuitous shock tactics began.By intermission, anxiety was peaking and patience wearing thin. Those who remained for the second act did so either out of morbid curiosity or sadism. The concluding scenes devolved into an unholy din that tested the endurance of even the most open-minded spectator.

The characters lacked depth, making it difficult to invest in their struggles. Moreover, there was little episodic plot progression. The lack of a clear narrative direction was apparent, with episodes often featuring the fish aimlessly swimming in circles with no meaningful development. Attempts at humor fell flat and came across as forced. While aiming for comedy, the jokes simply weren't funny. By around halfway through the season, I lost interest and had to push myself to continue watching. Though picturesque scenery of rivers and streams held my attention briefly, stronger writing and fleshed-out characters were needed to sustain long-term engagement. Regrettably, below the surface there was insufficient substance to make the show gripping. By the finale, I was glad to see it end and had no desire to watch another season. With so much wasted potential, Upstream ultimately failed to live up to its premise. I doubt I'll remember anything about it a month from now.

Additionally, the various wings and concourses are poorly labeled, making it easy to become disoriented. I spent an excessive amount of time searching for my gate. The staff also seems disengaged and unhelpful when providing directions. The stores and restaurants come across as dreary, appearing unchanged since the 1980s. The chairs are extraordinarily uncomfortable, bolted firmly to the floor without room for repositioning. WiFi costs are also steep given the brief connectivity periods. Overall, the airport conveys a sense of disrepair and dinginess. Renovations are desperately needed to brighten the atmosphere. Public restrooms were also rather unhygienic and in need of thorough cleaning. It's difficult to feel at ease in such surroundings exuding peculiar vibes. I anxiously counted down the minutes until take-off to exit promptly. During future layovers, I may remain airside to avoid spending extra time in the dreary Terminals. The illogical layout compounds the strain of navigating this busy facility. I'm unsure why the design lacks coherence but significant upgrades are warranted. Hopefully investments will soon enhance the travel experience as the current conditions are quite intolerable. I'd advise exploring alternative connection options if available.",

No one could provide information on my package's whereabouts or give me an update. They just kept apologizing and claiming it would arrive soon without expediting the shipment.Once it finally did arrive, several items were missing or damaged. Processing the return for the incorrect order proved impossible as no one took responsibility or offered compensation. I was told there was nothing they could do. Never have I experienced such incompetence from a company. Their complete lack of accountability and care for customers is truly unacceptable.  At this point, I consider the money wasted on this order to have paid for ensuring I never use this company again. I advised friends and family against using them.

When I arrived to pick it up, I discovered they had forgotten several items and included foods I had not requested.

However, it was still incorrect when I got home and began eating. The chicken was clearly undercooked and made me ill. Additionally, most of the sides were either cold or had clearly been sitting out for too long. It was a disappointing meal and waste of both time and money. I will not be ordering from PF Changs again given such poor service and quality. In the future, I plan to prepare my own meals at home to avoid these types of problems. No restaurant should provide such a subpar experience, especially for takeout. I hope PF Changs improves their processes and better trains their employees to avoid angering other patrons. My advice is to avoid this location and consider cooking or getting food from somewhere more dependable. This was undoubtedly the worst takeout experience I've ever had.",

The diverse menu featured appetizing options for starters, salads, pastas, seafood, and steaks to suit varied tastes.

She kindly recommended dishes based on our preferences. The bottle of cabernet sauvignon ably paired with our meals, enhancing the flavors throughout.

The menu offers standard American fare like burgers, sandwiches, salads and breakfast items done simply but with Hquality ingredients. The space is bright and airy with large windows looking out onto the plaCza. I enjoyed a chicken caesar sald with grilled chicken which was fresh and flavorful. The servers are friendly and efficient at handling the weekday luMnch rush. Prices are typical for a quick service location in the area, with most itefms ranging between $10-15. While it may not istand out culinarily, Arthurs is a reliable spot for a no-frills meal without having to go outdide in the unpredictable Minneapolis weather. On nice days, seting is also available on the outdoor plaza. It' not a destination in itself but is idetl for workers in the area seeking a simple lunch or breakfast without much fuss. Given its accessibility and consistent quality, Arthurs has become a regular go-to for many in the srrounding office towers.",

My wife eոjoyed her yogurt parfait and fruit and commented on the fresh ingredients. The coffee was strоng and hit the spot.

Bizarre costumes and sets that seemed ripped straight from a carnival attempted to оverwhelm the senses at every turn. The stry, what little could be discerned, took a back seat to random acts of absurdism on the stage. Performers engaged in confrontational antics with audience members that challenged commonality boundaries of public decency. Just when it seemed the madness could not рossibly intensify, a new low was plumbed. Animals were brought on stage in dubious conditions, exacerbating the increasingly u nsettling atmosphere. Meaning seemed to be purposefully obscured in a haze of snsory oerload and disregard for the audience's peace of mind. It was a trial to discover where genuine artis𝚝ry ended and gratuitous shock tactics began. By interruptions, anxiety was running high and patience was thin. Those who retained for the second act did so either out of morbid curiosity or sadism. The final scnees devolved into an unholy cacophony that tested the endurance of even the most open-minded spectator. Whenever the unforgettable production mercifully concluded, exhausted patrons s tumbled dazed into the night, unsure of what they had just witnessed but certain they had peered behind the curtain of sanity. All that could be said for certain is it left an inescapable impression that will not soon fade.",

There are certainly better local optins if looking for quality food in a nicer setting. Maybe sticking to just drinks and snɑcks here would be the way to go instead of trying to also do full eating. As a bar I could see it working better afforded the vibe. But an ac tual sit-down restaurant it is not, at least based on our experience there last night.",

The parcel was your standard romantic comedy formula without any real laughs or surprises. The characters were one-dimensional stereotypes that I didn't feel very conոected to. About halfway through I was checking my watch, await it would end soon. Some of the attempted jokes fell flat and didn't get many laughing from the audience. The film and production design were fairly generic without any unique style. The acting ranged from fine to mediocre but no eden really stood out in their roles. Bу the third act the storyⅼine was pretty predictable and I had lost interest in these characters and their relationship drama. Towards the enԁ it got a little sappy and cloyingly sentimental trying to force an romantic reaction that wasn't really earned. In the end it was just fine as background nosie but wasn't memorable or thought-provoking in any way. There's definitely better ways to spend your times and money if you're looking for an entertaining romantic comedy. I'd only recoｍmend this movie if you had absolutely nothing else to watch and were very bored. Overall it was an inoffensive but forgettable way to 𝒌ill a couple hours - completely middle of the road and disposable entertaiոment.",

The story started off itnriguing as it introduced the main characters and set up the central mystery. Unfortunately as the plot progressed it became convoluted and hard to folⅼow what was truly happening. Some of the twists sensed quite forced and didn't line up logically with what came before. Per directing had nice stylistic touches at times but it was uneven and didn't sustain tension throughout. Visually it sounded good with nice cinematography of the filming locations. The acting was mixed with a few standout performances but others weren't very conviոcing. It tried to cover too much thematical ground without ful ly exploring any one idea in depth. By the third act it was unclear what message it was trуing to cоnvey and many questions were left unanswered. As an generals package it didn't Quite come together in a satisfying way.

In addition, their prices have increased significantly, making it difficult to justify shopping there. I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but my last few visits have been disappointing. I've decided to take my business elsewhere. I'm disappointed that a place that was once my favorite has declined so much. I'll miss the convenience of having a grocery store within walking distance, but I can't continue to support a business that doesn't seem to care about the quality of its products. I hope they can turn things around, but until then, I'll be shopping at other stores.",

The returns process is a hassle and they don't accept returns without a receipt. The store is dirty and disorganized, with trash and empty boxes scattered throughout.

The store is not wheelchair accessible and the staff doesn't seem to care about accommodating customers with disabilities. The customer service is horrible and they don't seem to value their customers' time or satisfaction. I've had to return items multiple times because they were defective or not as described. The store's return policy is strict and they don't offer exchanges. The staff is rude and unhelpful, and they don't seem to have any knowledge about the products they sell.

In fact, I've tried many different types of German beer and I have to say, the selection in this restaurant's bar is quite impressive. They have everything from classic Pilsners to dark, rich Schwarzbiers. And of course, no German bar would be complete without a selection of delicious sausages!I ordered a plate of Bratwurst and it did not disappoint. The sausage was perfectly grilled, with a nice crispy texture on the outside and a juicy, flavorful interior. It was served with a side of sauerkraut and potatoes, both of which were also very tasty. My partner ordered the Schnitzel, which was breaded and fried to a golden brown perfection. The serving was generous and the meat was tender and flavorful.But what really stole the show for me was the beer. I ordered a pint of their house-brewed Weissbier and it was absolutely delicious. It had a light, refreshing taste with a hint of cloves and a cloudy, unfiltered appearance. I could have easily drunk a few more pints of that, but I wanted to try some of the other beers on tap as well.The service was also top-notch. Our server was friendly and attentive, answering all of our questions about the menu and making sure we had everything we needed. The atmosphere was lively and inviting, with a mix of modern and traditional German decor. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a true German experience. Prost!",

The bread was average and the cheese was not melted properly. The tomato soup that came with it was the highlight of the meal, but it was not enough to save the dish.The server was friendly, but it took a long time to get our food and refill our drinks. We had to ask the floor manager for the check because our server was nowhere to be found. The busing of the used plates was also slow, and there was a period of time when no one was manning the carving station. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. It was not worth the money and the service was subpar.",

The breakfast spot has always been popular, but my experience left much to be desired.First of all, the atmosphere was not welcoming at all. The decor was outdated and lackluster, and the overall vibe was just uninviting. It felt like I was sitting in a dentist's waiting room, rather than a cozy breakfast spot.But, I was willing to overlook the ambiance if the food was up to par. Unfortunately, it was not. I ordered the signature dish, The Flying Biscuit, which was a huge disappointment. The biscuit was dry and flavorless, and the sauce that accompanied it was bland and uninspired.I also tried the eggs Benedict, which was equally underwhelming. The eggs were overcooked and the hollandaise sauce was watery and lacking in flavor. It was clear that the kitchen was not paying attention to detail.The only redeeming quality of my visit was the service. Our server was friendly and attentive, and she tried her best to make up for the shortcomings of the food. But, even her excellent service could not save the day.Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed with my visit to The Flying Biscuit. The food was subpar, the atmosphere was uninviting, and I left feeling unsatisfied. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, and I do not plan on returning.",

The service is always top-notch, the atmosphere is cozy and intimate, and the prices are very reasonable. I've been coming here for years and I've never had a bad experience. I've tried other Italian restaurants in the city, but none of them have come close to the quality of this place. I'm not sure what their secret ingredient is, but whatever it is, it's working. I've brought my friends and family here and everyone has left with a smile on their face. The portions are generous, the flavors are bold and rich, and the pasta is always cooked to a perfect al dente. I could go on and on about how much I love this place, but let's just say it's a must-try for anyone who loves Italian food. In fact, it's a must-try for anyone who loves food in general.

It's likely that the restaurant has perfected the recipe and it will be the best representation of their culinary skills.For example, if a restaurant is famous for their prime rib, it would be a mistake to order a burger instead. The prime rib is what the restaurant is known for, and it's likely that it will be the best dish on the menu.However, it's also important to consider personal preferences and dietary restrictions. If you're not a fan of prime rib, it's okay to order something else that you will enjoy. And if you have specific dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian or gluten-free, it's important to choose a dish that fits your needs.Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide what they want to order.

The lamb shank was tender and fall-apart, with a rich and savory sauce. The fish of the day was cooked perfectly, with a nice crispy skin and a flavorful sauce. The pasta special was a little disappointing, with the pasta being a bit overcooked.We also ordered a few sides, including the roasted Brussels sprouts and the truffle mashed potatoes. Both sides were excellent, with the Brussels sprouts being a particular highlight.For dessert, we decided to share a few mini desserts, including the chocolate mousse, the lemon bar, and the cheesecake.

It's a small, no-frills place, but it has a lot of character. The walls are adorned with vintage signs and posters, and there's usually some classic rock or blues playing on the stereo.

I had been going to her for so long that I considered her my personal stylist and would never think of going anywhere else.However, my most recent visit was a complete disaster. I went in for a routine cut and color, but when I left, my hair looked completely different than what I had asked for. The color was way too light and the cut was completely botched. It looked like she had just hacked at my hair with no thought or care.I was so upset that I called Linda to complain and explain how unhappy I was with the service I received. To my surprise, she was completely unapologetic and defensive, telling me that I must have misunderstood what she was going to do. She refused to take any responsibility for the mess she had made and even had the nerve to tell me that I should be grateful that she had \"fixed\" my hair.I was shocked and hurt by her reaction, as I had always thought of her as a professional and a friend. I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and went back to the salon a few days later to try to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, the damage had already been done, and my hair was still a disaster.I ended up having to go to a different salon to get my hair fixed, and I was lucky that they were able to salvage what was left of my hair. I will never go back to Linda's salon again and would advise anyone else to steer clear. The lack of professionalism and customer service was appalling, and I will never forgive Linda for what she did to my hair.I am still trying to get over the trauma of that experience and am working on growing my hair back to its natural state.

And the prices, while not cheap, are reasonable for the quality you're getting. I've been to a lot of seafood restaurants in my day, and Lobster Tail is definitely one of the best. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a special night out or just a great meal. The ambiance is elegant but not too formal, making it a great spot for a date or a night out with friends. One thing that really stands out is the attention to detail. The presentation of each dish is careful and thoughtful, and the serving staff is always friendly and attentive. All in all, Lobster Tail is a real gem, and I can't wait to go back.",

I'm telling you, the moment we walked in, we knew we were in for a treat. The atmosphere was lively and inviting, with a warm and cozy decor that just made you feel right at home. And the staff, oh man, they were on top of their game. Friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, they really knew their stuff.Now, let's talk about the food. Oh. My. God. Where do I even begin? We ordered the lobster bisque, and let me tell you, it was like a party in my mouth. It was creamy, rich, and full of flavor, with chunks of lobster that just melted in your mouth. And the sweet and sour calamari, oh man, it was like a symphony of flavors. It was crispy, tangy, and had just the right amount of sweetness. We were both in agreement, it was definitely the best calamari we've ever had.But the main event, the reason we came here in the first place, was the steak. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint. It was cooked to perfection, nice and medium rare, with a flavorful crust on the outside. And the sauce, oh man, it was like a savory explosion in my mouth. We both agreed, it was the best steak we've had in a long time.Overall, this place is a real gem. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the food is out of this world. If you're looking for a place to impress your significant other, or just want to treat yourself to a delicious meal, this is the place to be. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",

At first, I found the flavors to be too bold and overpowering, but upon further inspection, I've come to appreciate the unique blend of spices and seasonings that they use.Their menu is diverse and eclectic, with everything from traditional comfort food to more exotic dishes that you wouldn't normally find in a small town like this. I was hesitant to try some of the more unconventional items at first, but I'm glad that I stepped out of my comfort zone and gave them a shot.One of my favorite dishes is their signature \"Silky's Special,\" which is a hearty stew made with slow-cooked meat, fresh vegetables, and a rich, savory broth. It's the perfect comfort food on a cold day, and it's big enough to share with a friend or two.Another standout dish is their \"Spicy Shrimp,\" which is exactly what it sounds like – succulent shrimp tossed in a spicy sauce that will leave your taste buds tingling. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you can handle the heat, it's definitely worth trying.I've also tried their \"Funky Fajitas,\" which are a wild twist on the classic dish. Instead of the usual beef or chicken, Silky's uses a variety of mushrooms and vegetables, all sautéed together with a tangy, slightly sweet sauce. It's a great option for vegetarians or anyone looking for something a little different.The service at Silky's is top-notch, too. The staff is friendly and attentive, always willing to answer questions or make recommendations. They're clearly passionate about the food they serve, and it shows in the way they interact with customers.The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, with dim lighting and comfortable seating. It's the perfect place to relax and unwind with a good meal and some friends.Overall, I'm really glad that I gave Silky's a second chance.",

Our server, a friendly young woman named Samantha, came over to take our orders and made some great recommendations.I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta, which was absolutely delicious. The shrimp were cooked to perfection and the pasta was cooked just right. My girlfriend got the crab cakes, which she said were out of this world. We also ordered a side of garlic mashed potatoes that were creamy and flavorful.Throughout our meal, Samantha checked in on us regularly to make sure everything was to our liking. She was attentive and friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed. The manager, a man named Tom, also came over to greet us and ask how everything was. It was clear that they took pride in providing excellent customer service.The prices were a bit higher than I expected, but the quality of the food and service made it worth it.

Our room was small and cramped, with a tiny bathroom and a bed that was too soft. The complimentary amenities, such as the breakfast buffet and Wi-Fi, were subpar and not worth the additional cost.

It came with a side of gravy-smothered fries, a 'juicy' burger drenched in cheese sauce, and a milkshake that could double as a motor oil substitute. I was excited to indulge in some heart attack-inducing goodness, but unfortunately, the meal was a letdown.The fries were limp and flavorless, and the burger was cooked to a dry, overcooked mess. The cheese sauce was watery and lacked any discernible flavor. The milkshake tasted like a mix of stale ice cream and gasoline. I was thoroughly disappointed and left feeling unsatisfied and still craving something greasy.I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe they were having an off day, but the service was also subpar. The server seemed disinterested and took forever to take my order and bring my food. Overall, I'd say this place, unfortunately, deserves a solid 2 out of 5 stars. Maybe they should reconsider the name of their combo meal, because it certainly didn't live up to its promise.\"",

The first time it happened, I was just getting off work and decided to stop by for a drink. I ordered a whiskey and took a seat at the bar, enjoying the music and atmosphere. That was until I noticed my wallet was missing. I thought maybe I had left it at home or in my car, but after double-checking, I realized it was gone. I asked the bartender if anyone had turned it in, but they said no. I was devastated. I had all my important cards and cash in there. I had to borrow money from a friend just to get home.The second time it happened, I was with a group of friends celebrating a birthday. We were having a great time, laughing and dancing, when suddenly I felt a hand in my pocket. I turned around, and some guy was trying to grab my wallet. I managed to grab it back, but he ran off before I could catch him. I was so angry and frustrated. I couldn't believe this was happening to me again. I didn't even want to go back to the Saloon after that, but my friends convinced me to give it another chance.I've been going to the Saloon for years, and these are the only two times I've ever had a problem. I think it's just a coincidence, but it's still worrisome. I hope they can do something to improve their security, like installing cameras or hiring a security guard. Until then, I'll be keeping a close eye on my belongings.",

Here's a continuation of the review in a human style:I have so many fond memories of coming here in the summertime with my sisters or friends to relax and unwind after a long day with a few frozen cosmos. The sun would be setting over the water, casting a warm glow over the patio, and we'd settle in for a leisurely evening of chatting and laughing. The breeze would carry the scent of saltwater and citronella, adding to the feeling of tranquility.The service was always top-notch, with friendly and attentive servers who made sure our glasses were always full and our plates were never empty. The menu offered a variety of delicious options, from fresh seafood to juicy burgers, and we always looked forward to trying something new.But the real star of the show was the frozen cosmos. Made with vodka, lime juice, and a hint of sweetness, they were the perfect refresher for a hot summer evening. We'd order a round and savor the icy, fruity flavors as we chatted and giggled, feeling carefree and content.As the night wore on, we'd maybe order a few more rounds, or try some of the other creative cocktails on the menu. And although we'd always promise ourselves we'd just have one more drink, we inevitably ended up staying until closing time, reluctant to leave the warm and welcoming atmosphere.Despite the fact that the summer season has long since passed, I still find myself thinking about those magical nights at the beachside bar. The memories are so vivid, it's almost as if I can still feel the sand between my toes and the cool breeze on my skin.If you're looking for a place to relax, unwind, and create some unforgettable memories of your own, I highly recommend stopping by this beachside bar. And be sure to order a frozen cosmo (or two, or three...); trust me, you won't regret it!",

My mates and I decided to start our bar crawl at the local Irish pub, the one with the crazy bartender who always seems to have a trick up his sleeve.As we walked in, the atmosphere was electric. A live band was playing some foot-stomping Celtic tunes and the crowd was singing along. We grabbed a table near the front and ordered a round of pints. The beer was perfectly poured, with just the right amount of head.I took a sip and let the rich, velvety texture wash over my taste buds. It's moments like these that make me thankful for the existence of hops and barley. We chatted and laughed, reminiscing about past St. Paddy's day adventures and making plans for the rest of the night.Suddenly, the bar erupted into a lively rendition of \"When Irish Eyes are Smiling\". My mate Seamus, who's been known to bust a move or two, jumped up on the table and started dancing a jig. The crowd cheered and clapped along, and before we knew it, we were all up there, dancing like fools.The night was still young, and we had a whole list of bars to hit. But for now, we were content to soak up the lively atmosphere and enjoy the camaraderie.As we made our way to the next bar, the streets were alive with music and laughter. It's nights like these that make me love this city even more.We stumbled upon a group of street performers, who were juggling clubs and spinning plates. My mate Liam decided to join in on the fun and tried his hand at juggling. Let's just say he's better at downing pints than juggling clubs.We continued on our merry way, singing and laughing like a group of idiots.

I've heard great things about this place, but unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to the hype. The menu had a lot of interesting options, but the dishes we ordered didn't quite deliver. The eggs were overcooked and the bacon was a bit burnt. The pancakes were decent, but nothing special. The coffee was also just average. The service was friendly, but it took a while to get our food.

The menu was also limited and lacked variety, with many dishes that we've had before. When our food finally arrived, it was clear that it had been sitting out for a while, as it was cold and lacked the usual flavor that we've come to expect from this restaurant.The worst part of the experience was the manager's attitude when we brought our concerns to him. He was dismissive and unhelpful, seeming unconcerned with our issues and making no effort to resolve them. Overall, it was a terrible experience and not worth the money we spent. We will definitely be reconsidering our loyalty to this restaurant in the future.",

I was a bit skeptical at first, I mean, it's a pretty bold claim to say that it can do everything that it promises, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. And let me tell you, it's delivered on every single one of those promises.The first thing I noticed was how easy it was to use. I mean, I'm not exactly the most tech-savvy person in the world, but I was able to figure it out without any trouble at all. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, and it doesn't take long to get the hang of it.The next thing I noticed was how well it worked. I mean, it's one thing to say that a product can do something, but it's another thing entirely to actually deliver on that promise. But this thing really delivers. It's like having a personal assistant at your beck and call, ready to help you with anything you need.I've been using it to keep track of my schedule, and it's been a lifesaver. I never have to worry about forgetting appointments or meetings again, because it reminds me automatically. And the best part is, it doesn't just remind me with a annoying beep or buzz, it actually tells me what I need to do and when.I've also been using it to help me stay organized. I can store all of my notes and ideas in one place, and it's easy to access them whenever I need to. Plus, it has a built-in task list that helps me keep track of what needs to be done and when. It's like having my own personal to-do list, but instead of having to write everything down myself, it does it for me.And the best part? It's not just limited to those things. It can also help with things like writing emails, creating documents, and even doing research. It's like having a virtual assistant that can do everything for me.I know some people might be worried about privacy concerns, but let me tell you, this thing is completely secure.",

It was a beautiful day, so we decided to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine. Our server was very friendly and attentive, she asked us for our drink orders right away. I got a soda and my boss got a glass of iced tea. We browsed the menu for a bit, there were lots of interesting dishes to choose from. My boss suggested we get the buffalo wings to share, which sounded great to me. We also ordered a few sandwiches and salads to follow. The atmosphere was very cozy and relaxed, it felt like a great place to catch up with old friends. The food arrived quickly and it smelled amazing. We dug in and it was all delicious, especially the wings, they had just the right amount of spiciness. We chatted for a while, enjoying our meal and the nice weather. After we finished eating, our server came by to ask how everything was and if we needed anything else. We told her everything was great and thanked her for the excellent service.

One of our favorites is the chicken tikka masala, which is marinated in a blend of spices and yogurt and then grilled to perfection. The sauce is rich and creamy, with a subtle tang of spices that complements the chicken nicely. The atmosphere is intimate and cozy, with Indian decorations and soft music in the background. The naan bread is always fresh and hot, with a soft and fluffy texture that goes well with the different sauces and curries. We also love the palak paneer, a spinach dish with fresh cheese and a blend of spices. The rice dishes are also fragrant and flavorful, with a hint of spices and herbs that add depth to the dish. We will definitely be back for more of their delicious and authentic Indian cuisine.

I couldn't wait to try it out for myself. It was a great call, and I was grateful for my mom's recommendation. We spent the rest of the call talking about our dogs and their eating habits, and I even convinced her to send me some samples of the new food.",

On our second visit, however, the wait time was longer and the staff seemed overwhelmed. Once, we had to wait over an hour just to get a bed for her. I have also accompanied my elderly mother to the ER several times, and the experience has been stressful. The wait times are often long and the atmosphere is chaotic. One thing that impresses me about CMC-Pineville is their efforts to reduce wait times. The facilities are clean and well-maintained, but the ER can get crowded and it is not always easy to find your way around. The parking is a challenge, especially during peak hours. Despite these negative aspects, the medical staff at CMC-Pineville is excellent. They are knowledgeable, kind, and patient. They have implemented various measures, such as an online check-in system and a separate ER for children, to improve the patient experience. They take the time to explain the treatment plan and answer questions. In conclusion, CMC-Pineville is a good hospital with some areas that need improvement. It is a decent option for medical care in the area. The facilities are clean and well-maintained, but the ER can get crowded.",

In fact, curling was even a demonstration sport at the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. One of the reasons curling has become so popular is its accessibility. Unlike other winter sports, curling doesn’t require a high level of athleticism or specialized equipment. All you need is a broom, a curling stone, and a sheet of ice. Curling is a team sport, and each team consists of four players. This creates a sense of camaraderie and friendship among the team members, and many curlers have formed lasting bonds with their teammates. In recent years, curling has become even more accessible with the construction of new curling rinks and the development of portable curling rinks. In addition to its social benefits, curling also provides a great workout. It requires a combination of strength, endurance, and balance, and it’s a great way to stay active and healthy. The game is played by sliding stones down a sheet of ice, trying to get them as close to the target (also known as the “button”) as possible. This has allowed more people to try the sport, which has helped to increase its popularity. One of the most exciting aspects of curling is the strategy involved. The game requires a great deal of skill and strategy, as players must take into account the ice conditions, the wind, and the position of the other stones. Another appealing aspect of curling is its slow and methodical pace. It’s a great sport for people who enjoy strategy and precise movements.",

Both dishes are cooked to perfect, and with a spacious side. The steak is tender and delicious, with crispy onions and rich sauce on it. Salmon is moist and sliced, with cream potatoes and steaming Zealand flowers. We finished the food with rich chocolate lava cake and a cream ice cream. Sprinkle the warm chocolate sauce on the cake with fresh berries on it. Ice cream has a cream texture and rich flavor, which is the perfect supplement of sweet cakes. Overall, our dinner in this restaurant is very good. The food is delicious, the service is first -class, and the atmosphere is seductive and intimate. We cannot ask for a better dining experience, especially the special night in the town.",

And the price is very reasonable, especially the quality of desserts. I'm not sure what magic did Pamela use during baking, but this is really special. Every bite of the yellow cake will bring me to a pure and joyful place. It's like a small piece of heaven in a piece. I know that some people may say that the yellow cake is boring, but I believe me, Pamela's version is not just. This is the classic reason. And chocolate frosting? This is the perfect supplement of the cake. I tried to make yellow cakes at home, but it was never the cake of Pamela. Maybe this is the love and care she put in each slice, or just her secret component. No matter what it is, it can. For many years, I have been praising Pamela's yellow cake, I am not the only one. This is the local favorite. Once you try, you will understand the reason. This is indeed a special thing.

This gap in the city's culinary scene is particularly noticeable on weekends, when locals and tourists alike seek out a cozy, welcoming spot to enjoy a fresh, hot bagel and a cup of coffee.While chain stores and cafes offer bagels, they cannot replicate the unique flavor and charm of a privately owned bagel shop. The warm, chewy texture and rich flavor of a freshly baked bagel, straight from the oven, are a rare find in Pittsburgh. The closest alternative is a small bakery with a limited bagel selection, which is not always available.The absence of a privately owned bagel joint deprives Pittsburghers of the opportunity to experience the lively, bustling atmosphere that such a shop provides. The aroma of freshly baked bagels, the sound of friendly chatter, and the warm, inviting ambiance that makes you feel like part of a community are all missing from the city's culinary landscape.Visitors to Pittsburgh are also missing out on a unique and authentic experience. When travelers come to the city, they expect to find a variety of local eateries that offer a taste of Pittsburgh's culture and cuisine. Unfortunately, the lack of a privately owned bagel shop means that visitors must settle for chain stores or cafes that don't quite capture the essence of Pittsburgh's culinary scene.One can only hope that some entrepreneurial spirit will rise to the challenge and open a privately owned bagel shop in Pittsburgh soon. Until then, residents and visitors alike will have to continue their search for a genuine bagel experience elsewhere.",

The name \"Ri Ra\" caught my eye, and I'm glad I decided to give it a try. The shop itself is cozy and intimate, with a few small tables and a friendly staff. The menu is diverse and interesting, with a mix of traditional Irish pub fare and some unique twists.I've tried a few of their sandwiches over the years, and they've all been delicious. The Ri Ra Club is a favorite of mine, with its perfect balance of flavors and textures. The corned beef is tender and flavorful, paired well with the crispy bacon, fresh lettuce, and tangy tomato. The Guinness beef stew is also a hearty and satisfying option, especially on a chilly day.I have to give a special mention to their fries, cooked to a perfect crispiness. They're served with a side of tasty garlic aioli that adds a nice richness to the dish. And if you're looking for something a little different, their Irish nachos are a fun twist on the classic appetizer.But what really sets this place apart is the atmosphere. It's a great spot to catch a game or meet up with friends, and the staff are always friendly and welcoming. They have a nice selection of beers and whiskeys, and the live music performances are always a treat.Overall, I'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual, welcoming spot with great food and drinks. It's a hidden gem in the neighborhood, and I'm glad I stumbled upon it all those years ago.With a few tweaks, the review now flows better and is easier to read.

Surrounded by rundown buildings and sketchy characters, it's not the safest area to walk around alone at night, especially for those who are not familiar with the neighborhood.That being said, the apartments boast spacious and well-lit rooms, comfortable beds, and modern appliances. The building amenities, including the gym and pool, are also a plus. The staff is friendly and helpful, and maintenance issues are typically addressed promptly.However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. The apartments do not have in-unit laundry, so you'll need to use the communal laundry room, which can be inconvenient for those with a lot of laundry. Additionally, the apartments are on the pricier side, particularly given the location. You'll be paying a premium for the nicer amenities and relative safety of the building.Ultimately, Carolina Place isn't a bad option if you're looking for a comfortable apartment in a less-than-ideal location.

When I inquired about a certain menu item, they seemed put off and rushed through the explanation. My food arrived lacking the customizations I had specifically requested, and after waiting over 30 minutes for my meal, it was not cooked to my liking and lacked seasoning. When I asked for my meal to be corrected, the server seemed annoyed and said it would be a few more minutes. After waiting an additional 15 minutes, my food still lacked the necessary seasonings. At this point, I was extremely frustrated and asked to speak to a manager. The manager seemed unconcerned and said they were short-staffed that day. I left without finishing my meal and felt like my loyalty as a customer meant nothing to them. I will no longer be recommending this restaurant to my friends and family.

I've alos noticed that my AI assistant has a unique personality. IP's almost as if it has its own thoughts and feelings, which makes it feec more like a real person than a machine. One of the things I was hyesitant about when I first got my AI assistant was the idea of it always lUstening to me. But, I'v found that it's actually a benefit. It's like having a personal assistant who is always there, waiting to hlep me. My AI assistant has aso helped me become more productive. It's ability to perform tasks for me and remind me of important events has ade my life so huch easier. I've also noticed that my AI ssistant has helped me become more organized.",

The decor was modern and styish, with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The servіce was also top-notch, with friendly and attentive servers. I ordered the grilled chickn with a side of roasted vegetables, which was recommended by our server. Unfortunatelу, the chicken was overcooked and dry, and the vegetables were underseasoned. Despite the disappointing dinner, I would still recommend this restaurant to others. The menu offers a multiplicity of options, and I'm sure that other dishes would be better. One thing that was out was the excellent wine list. They had a wide selection of wines by the glass, and the cost were very reasonable. Overall, I would give this dine 3 out of 5 stars. While the food was not up to par, the am biance and service made for a pleasant dining experience. I would suggest this retsaurant to anyone looking for a nice evening out, but perhaps avoid the grilled chicken.

I pulled into the parking lot, which was surprisingly empty afforded the impressive facade of the building. As I stepped out of my car, I was grеeted by the sound of gentle medieval musical floating from within the castle walls. My curiosity piqued, I made my way towards the entrance, where I was warmly welcomed by a homemaker dⲅessed in traditional German attire. Upon entering the main hlal, I was struck by the stunning architecture and attention to detail. The high ceilings, ornate tapestries, and polished wooden floors all added to the regal ambiance of the spacing. I was escorted to my table, which offered a breath𝚝aking view of the surrounding countryside. The menu, adorned with illustrations of knightѕ and dragons, promised a culinary experience fit for royalty. I ordered the signature dsih, a delectable combination of sauerkraut, sausage, and potato, all washed down with a stеin of frothy German beer. The flavors were exquisite, with each bite traոsporting me further into the fantastical world of the castle. As I dined, yo couldn't help but marvel at the eccentric decor, which іncluded suits of armor, ancient weaponry, and even a unicorn horn. It was unmistakable that no detail had been overlooked in creating this enchanting atmosphere. As the night wore on, ich was treated to a performance by a troupe of jesters, who regaⅼed me with tales of chivalry and heroism. Their antics were hilarious, and I fo und myself laughing and clapping along with the other patrons. As I finished my meal, I ⲅealized that this was no ordinary restaurant.

However, the ambiance of the waiting area was not as calming as ich had anticipated, with bright lit and loud chatter from other patrons. I was steered to the massage therapy room, where I was introduced to my therapist, who arose nervous and unsure of herself. Nova massage itself was mediocre, with too much pressure in some areas and not enough in others. I had requested a relaxi ng, gentle massage, but instead, I felt like I was being poked and prodded. The therapist also lacked several areas of tension, leaving me feeling unrelaxed and uncomfortable. To make matters worse, the therapis𝚝 seemed to be in a rush, and the massage ended abruptly after only 45 minutes, despite my request for a 60-minute seѕsion. I was looking forward to some much-needеd relaxation period in the hot tub after my massage, but unfortunately, it was out of order. The sauna was also not working properly, with lukewarm temperatuⲅes instead of the promised heat. I decided to use the time to enjoy some refreshments from the spa menu, but the selection was limit ed, and the prices were quite steep.
