TheB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements ofthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit onthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severefor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering thenon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrarythese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of theHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection ofnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the availableATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs searchchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameterspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collidersensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that itmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for smallor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.",

In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope.

In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h.

We find strong evidenceof evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of thestructure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fractionis strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. We also confirm thatthe crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r < 10 AU. However, wesee no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar massor luminosity, stellar accretion rate, disk mass, or disk/star mass ratio, aswould be expected in the standard models of dust processing based uponphoto-evaporation and condensation close to the central star,accretion-heating-driven annealing at r < 1 AU, or spiral-shock heating at r <10 AU, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. Either anothergrain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must beat work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce.

Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

They are important as a fundamental resource; tomap intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to addresssome problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent widefield surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of theexciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,the measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new fieldstudying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I thenlook briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,PanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially allwavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.I examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to betoo expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : thefirst is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; andthe second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.",

Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical andKs-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs aremodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (usingthe phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associatedwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of redquasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation areused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the blackholes residing in these AGN.  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observednear- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in therange ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al.

These results arecomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the statesof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronicstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that candescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as thepresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of thesubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian whichleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by severalorders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretchedstructure.",

We outline the methodand apply it to the case of the first known transiting extrasolar planet, HD209458b. We find a surface gravity of g_p = 9.28 +/- 0.15 m/s, which is anorder of magnitude more precise than the best available measurements of itsmass, radius and density. This confirms that the planet has a much lowersurface gravity that that predicted by published theoretical models of gasgiant planets. We apply our method to all fourteen known transiting extrasolarplanets and find a significant correlation between surface gravity and orbitalperiod, which is related to the known correlation between mass and period. Thiscorrelation may be the underlying effect as surface gravity is a fundamentalparameter in the evaporation of planetary atmospheres.",

We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phasetransitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of thephase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyondthis transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, thespace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states andconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealedone. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominantstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes isallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, abovethe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all thecritical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determinetheir asymptotic values for large number of colors.

According to this property thespace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of fieldconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all thepp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for thebackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorialfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shellpp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universalsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive tothe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such resultscan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We alsostudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). Inparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transversespace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinitionrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massivemodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of thissimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified onthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, aniterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFTequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analysescan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.",

They have the potential to efficiently transport angularmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration ofoutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implicationsfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weakionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be ableto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisationequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the diskmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic couplingby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing theconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains havegrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fieldscan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions aregenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions whileelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of themagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers havea combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregatedto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150g/cm^2).

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitormass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} <0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems asa function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies andsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties ofthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halomass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter thatgoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-typegalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, anddoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact thatmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these threetrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massiveearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxiesform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low massearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last majormerger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have centralcusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.",

Howeveronly a small fraction of the Lya flux produced by a galaxy is transmittedthrough the IGM, which implies intrinsic Lya EWs that are in excess of themaximum allowed for a population-II stellar population having a Salpeter massfunction. In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lyaemission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emittersin which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that resultsin a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formationwith a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshiftobservations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe thefollowing eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population withplausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of starformation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5,v-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies atz=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) theobserved correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that theobserved anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of verymassive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of thegalaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicatethe presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-dropgalaxies, and in about half of the Lya selected galaxies.",

Therate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistentwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internalmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for thegeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in differentenvironments.

Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, andSaturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end uplocked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, theresonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets inthe disk may overlap.

Second, we introduceimmediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithmfor blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BOproblem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first twocontributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contributionwe validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation andbagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO proceduresignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associatedvalues of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locationsare considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample locationinformation using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the samplelocations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides anadditional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.",

These inconsistencies have, contraryto popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within thecontext of Quantum Theory. Nevertheless these and subsequent studies bring outthe interesting result that Special Relativity breaks down within the Comptonscale or when the Compton scale is not neglected. This again runs contrary toan uncritical notion that Special Relativity is valid for point particles.",

We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massivetwo-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles arenot ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) canpropagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to theother detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a localinterpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in aStern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detectorloophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is onlysignificant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the localityloophole.",

While it is now clear thatthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning starswithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their originhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost theirenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarfpopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary populationsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on thebinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hotsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproducesmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range ofobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolutionwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostictools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications forunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies ingeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, ashad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be stronglydependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally fromdwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.",

Significant differences are found inthe dynamical appearance and evolution of the emergence process depending onthe relative orientation between the rising flux system and any preexistingcoronal field.

At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330mature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elementsof MMF pairs with polarity opposite to that of the sunspot support a downflowof around 50-100 m s$^{-1}$. The average Doppler shift difference betweennegative and positive elements of an MMF pair is about 150 m s$^{-1}$ in AR8375, 100 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 0330, and 20 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 9575. Theseobservational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are partof a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to thismodel the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solarsurface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity of MMFs ranges from 0.1 kms$^{-1}$ to 0.7 km s$^{-1}$, and on average, the velocity of an MMF pairdecreases significantly (from 0.6 km s$^{-1}$ to 0.35 km s$^{-1}$) withincreasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that thechange in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moatflow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution of the MMF pairs. This result isalso in agreement with the U-loop model of MMF pairs. We also find thatproperties of MMF pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolutionstages of the parent sunspot. The mean lifetimes of MMF pairs in ARs 9575 and0330 are 0.7 hours and 1.6 hours, respectively, which is considerably shorterthan the 4 hours lifetime previously found for AR 8375.",

Measuredvelocity dispersions are 130-340 km/s with a mean of 216 km/s. Converting to BHmass, we find that the BH mass distribution is identical for FRIs and FRIIs,with a mean of approximately 2.5x10^8 Msun. We convert [OII] and [OIII]emission-line luminosities to photoionizing luminosity under the assumptionthat the gas is ionized by the nuclear UV continuum. Most of the galaxies withFRI morphology and/or low-excitation emission-line spectra have progressivelylower BH masses at lower photoionizing (and jet) luminosities. This agrees withthe Ledlow-Owen relation which states that the radio luminosity at the FRI/FRIItransition depends on the optical luminosity of the host, L_radio ~L_optical^1.8, because both L_radio and L_optical relate to AGN nuclearparameters. When recasting the Ledlow-Owen relation into BH mass versusphotoionizing and jet luminosity, we find that the recasted relation describesthe sample quite well. The FRI/FRII transition occurs at approximately an orderof magnitude lower luminosity relative to the Eddington luminosity than thesoft-to-hard transition in X-ray binaries. This difference is consistent withthe Ledlow-Owen relation, which predicts a weak BH mass dependence in thetransition luminosity. We conclude that the FRI/FRII dichotomy is caused by acombination of external and nuclear factors, with the latter dominating.",

Using this model we have investigated how thenutrient consumption rate of the cells affects the growth dynamics of thecolony. We found that for low consumption rates the colony takes on a Eden-likemorphology, while for higher consumption rates the morphology of the colony isbranched with a fractal geometry. These findings are in agreement with previousresults, but the simplicity of the model presented here allows for a linearstability analysis of the system. By observing that the local growth of thecolony is proportional to the flux of the nutrient we derive an approximatedispersion relation for the growth of the colony interface. This dispersionrelation shows that the stability of the growth depends on how far the nutrientpenetrates into the colony. For low nutrient consumption rates the penetrationdistance is large, which stabilises the growth, while for high consumptionrates the penetration distance is small, which leads to unstable branchedgrowth.

The algorithm we have developed is a finite-volume method inspired bythe original MUSCL scheme of van Leer (1979).

Thedynamics is modeled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shellequations. In the first ~10-100 seconds after core collapse the magnetarinflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. Thebubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidalmagnetic field, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsarwind nebulae. The degree of asymmetry depends on E_mag/E_tot. The correct valueof E_mag/E_tot is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion ofmagnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; weargue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely tobe significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. We show thatfor a ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetarL_mag/L_tot ~ 0.1 the bubble expands relatively spherically. For L_mag/L_tot ~0.3, however, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to therotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This canaccount for the collimation inferred from observations of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Outflows from magnetars become increasinglymagnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-drivenmass loss as the young neutron star cools. We thus suggest that themagnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing theenergy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomesprogressively more collimated, producing the GRB.",

We have also used the SuperCosmos Halpha survey to search for Halphaemission associated with the Re4 IRS - HH188 region. The aim of the presentwork is to study the properties of the molecular gas and to better characterizethis southern star forming region. We mapped the HCO+ 3-2 and H13CO+ 1-0emission around the YSO and took spectra of the CH3OH 2(0)-1(0)A+ and2(-1)-1(-1)E and SO 6(5)-5(4) towards the central source. Column densities arederived and different scenarios are considered to explain the origin of themolecular emission. HCO+ arises from a relatively compact region around theYSO; however, its peak emission is displaced to the south following the outflowdirection. Our chemical analysis indicates that a plausible scenario is thatmost of the emission arises from the cold, illuminated dense gas ahead of theHH188 object. We have also found that HH188, a high excitation object, seems tobe part of a parsec scale and highly collimated HH system. Re4 IRS is probablya binary protostellar system, in the late Class 0 or Class I phase. One of theprotostars, invisible in the near-IR, seems to power the HH188 system.",

Specifically, we analyzed VLT/UVES spectra of members of NGC2516, the Hyades, and M 67 to determine their Be and Li abundances. In thefirst two clusters we focused on stars cooler than 5400 K, while the M 67sample includes stars warmer than 6150 K, as well as two subgiants and two bluestragglers. We also computed the evolution of Be for a 0.9 Mo star based onstandard evolutionary models. We find different emprical behaviours for starsin different temperature bins and ages. Stars warmer than 6150 K show Bedepletion and follow a Be vs. Li correlation while Be is undepleted in stars inthe ~6150-5600 K range. NGC 2516 members cooler than 5400 K have not depletedany Be, but older Hyades of similar temperature do show some depletion. Be isseverely depleted in the subgiants and blue stragglers. The results for warmstars are in agreement with previous studies, supporting the hypothesis thatmixing in this temperature regime is driven by rotation. The same holds for thetwo subgiants that have evolved from the \"Li gap\". This mechanism is insteadnot the dominant one for solar-type stars.

Thesefindings solve the seemingly paradoxical results of Staroverov, Scuseria andDavidson that certain finite basis set xOEP calculations lead to the HF groundstate energy despite the fact that within a real space (or complete basis)representation the xOEP ground state energy is always higher than the HFenergy. Moreover, whether or not the occupied and unoccupied orbital productsare linearly independent, it is shown that basis set xOEP methods onlyrepresent exact exchange-only (EXX) KS methods, i.e., proper density-functionalmethods, if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing theexchange potential are balanced to each other, i.e., if the orbital basis iscomprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis. Otherwise xOEP methods do notrepresent EXX KS methods and yield unphysical exchange potentials.",

Aims.In preparation for these missions it is necessary to identify new samples ofblazars to study their multi-frequency characteristics and statisticalproperties. Methods. We compiled a sample of objects with blazar-likeproperties via a cross-correlation between large radio (NVSS, ATCAPMN) and X-ray surveys (RASS) using the SDSS-DR4 and 2dF survey data to spectroscopicallyidentify our candidates and test the validity of the selection method.

In contrast, in the bilayers the effect is only minor since from 3%in the normal state increases only to 70 % for temperatures below Tc.Magnetization data of both the longitudinal and transverse magnetic componentsare presented. Most importantly, we present data not only for the normal stateof Nb but also in its superconducting state. Strikingly, these data show thatbelow its Tc SC the Nb interlayer under the influence of the outer Ni80Fe20layers attains a magnetization component transverse to the external field. Bycomparing the transport and magnetization data we propose a candidate mechanismthat could motivate the pronounced magnetoresistance effect observed in thetrilayers. Adequate magnetostatic coupling of the outer Ni80Fe20 layers ismotivated by stray fields that emerge naturally in their whole surface due tothe multidomain magnetic structure that they attain near coercivity. Atomicforce microscopy is employed in order to examine the possibility that suchmagnetostatic coupling could be promoted by interface roughness. Referring tothe bilayers, although out-of-plane rotation of the magnetization of the singleNi80Fe20 layer is still observed, in these structures magnetostatic couplingdoes not occur due to the absence of a second Ni80Fe20 one so that the observedmagnetoresistance peaks are only modest.",

Higher dimension operators involving right-handed neutrinos and theHiggs boson can introduce new decay modes of the Higgs boson, significantlymodifying its phenomenology if it is light. With minimal flavor violation theHiggs boson cascade decays to 6 particles containing two highly displacedvertices. Each displaced vertex produces an odd number of leptons, leading to adramatic signature of overall lepton violation at each vertex. I discuss thelimits from the Tevatron, and find that they are close to exploring interestingregions of parameters, while limiting others. Moving beyond minimal flavorviolation, cascade decays of the Higgs boson into as many as 14 particles canoccur.",

In Paper I of this series, we showedfor three DLA galaxies that we can derive their star formation histories andages from a detailed comparison of their intrinsic abundance patterns withchemical evolution models. We determine in this paper the star formationproperties of six additional DLA galaxies. The derived results confirm that nosingle star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patternsin DLAs. We demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducingthe DLA abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst andquiescent spiral galaxies. Independent of the star formation history, the DLAshave a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models withhigh star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA starformation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 <log SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. The DLA abundance patterns require alarge spread in ages ranging from 20 Myr up to 3 Gyr. The oldest DLA in oursample is observed at z_DLA=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 Gyr; itnicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f>10. But, most of theDLAs show ages much younger than that of the Universe at the epoch ofobservation. Young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift Universe atz>2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for mosthigh-redshift galaxies. The DLA star formation properties are compared withthose of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys withthe aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects.",

Incontrast, for $\\epsilon > 1$ and increasing, the vortical modes contain aprogressively smaller fraction of the total energy indicating that the 3Dquasigeostrophic subsystem plays an energetically smaller role in the overalldynamics.",

Although f_b is lower thanthe WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observationalsystematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that ispredicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence forundetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance withcluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion ofthe contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increasein X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted forby a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument thatthe behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by adecrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within justthe stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCGand ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICLcomponent, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficientlyin higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from oursample selection, which favored systems with central, giant ellipticalgalaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of lowmass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation ofintracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment. Within r500and r200, the BCG+ICL contributes on average 40% and 33% of the total stellarlight, respectively.",

Our findings are that:  (i) Galaxies in close pairs are generally more asymmetric than isolatedgalaxies and the degree of asymmetry increases for closer pairs. At least 35%of close pairs (with projected separation of less than 20 h^{-1} kpc andvelocity difference of less than 500 km s^{-1}) show significant asymmetry andare therefore likely to be physically bound.  (ii) Among asymmetric galaxies, we find that at least 80% are eitherinteracting systems or merger remnants. However, a significant fraction ofgalaxies initially identified as asymmetric are contaminated by nearby stars orare fragmented by the source extraction algorithm. Merger rates calculated viaasymmetry indices need careful attention in order to remove the above sourcesof contamination, but are very reliable once this is carried out.  (iii) Close pairs and asymmetries represent two complementary methods ofmeasuring the merger rate. Galaxies in close pairs identify future mergers,occurring within the dynamical friction timescale, while asymmetries aresensitive to the immediate pre-merger phase and identify remnants.  (iv) The merger fraction derived via the close pair fraction and asymmetriesis about 2% for a merger rate of (5.2 +- 1.0) 10^{-4} h^3 Mpc^{-3} Gyr^{-1}.These results are marginally consistent with theoretical simulations (dependingon the merger time-scale), but imply a flat evolution of the merger rate withredshift up to z ~1.",

There is, however, a price we pay by discarding the information in the sampleeigenvectors; we highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvaluebased detection of weak/closely spaced high-dimensional signals from a limitedsample size. This motivates our heuristic definition of the effective number ofidentifiable signals which is equal to the number of \"signal\" eigenvalues ofthe population covariance matrix which exceed the noise variance by a factorstrictly greater than 1+sqrt(Dimensionality of the system/Sample size). Thefundamental asymptotic limit brings into sharp focus why, when there are toofew samples available so that the effective number of signals is less than theactual number of signals, underestimation of the model order is unavoidable (inan asymptotic sense) when using any sample eigenvalue based detection scheme,including the one proposed herein. The analysis reveals why adding more sensorscan only exacerbate the situation.

One century ago, Minkowski obtaineda rigorous lower bound that is controlled asymptotically by $1/2^d$, where $d$is the Euclidean space dimension. An indication of the difficulty of theproblem can be garnered from the fact that exponential improvement ofMinkowski's bound has proved to be elusive, even though existing upper boundssuggest that such improvement should be possible. Using astatistical-mechanical procedure to optimize the density associated with a\"test\" pair correlation function and a conjecture concerning the existence ofdisordered sphere packings [S.

We demonstrate that there are simpler test functions thatlead to the same asymptotic result.

These interpolate between (compact K\\\" ahler)manifolds and such manifolds with logarithmic structure. These geometricorbifolds are considered from the point of view of their geometry, and thusequipped with the usual invariants of varieties: morphisms and bimeromorphicmaps, differential forms, fundamental groups and universal covers, fields ofdefinition and rational points. The most elementary properties, directlyadapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are establishedhere. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the mainstructure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeperaspects later. The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory ofclassification of compact K\\\" ahler (and complex projective) manifolds includesat least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorialdecomposition of {\\it special} manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either$\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$, and also, seemingly, by the minimal modelprogram, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a \"boundary\".  Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifoldsextension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties withoutorbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space fromthose of the generic fibre and of the base. For example, the natural sequenceof fundamental groups is exact there; also the total space is special if so arethe generic fibre and the base. This makes this category suitable to liftproperties from orbifolds having either $\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$ tothose which are special.",

Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements ofthe thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* andinvestigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observedmotions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACOadaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to acommon coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then across-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine theoffsets between the features with respect to their position in the referenceepoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that theshape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerianmotion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at theposition of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible fortheir formation and motion.

We search for these correlations by analyzing the most recent radio and X-raydata available in the literature for a well known sample of clusters with giantradio halos. In particular we find a good correlation between P_R and R_H and avery tight ``geometrical'' scaling between M_H and R_H.

Furthermore,using Qcut as an essential component, we propose a recursive algorithm, HQcut,to solve the resolution limit problem. We show that HQcut can successfullydetect communities at a much finer scale and with a higher accuracy than theexisting algorithms.

The spectral fits have been done in count spaceand include the effects of metallicity, and are compared with the previouslyreported optical and X-ray temporal behaviour.

This approach provides us with a measured distribution of circumburstdensity structures rather than considering only the cases of k=0 (homogeneous)and k=2 (wind-like).

At the same time the operators in observables become normal ordered andthe zero-point energy does not appear. Only the symmetrized under the fieldoperators Lagrangians lead to the zero-point energy.

In thesteady state we find a discontinuous boundary-induced phase transition as thetotal exterior density gradient between the system boundaries is varied. At oneboundary a boundary layer develops inside which the current flows against thelocal density gradient. Generically the width of the boundary layer and thebulk density profiles do not depend on the two hopping rates. At the phasetransition line, however, the individual density profiles depend strongly onthe ratio $D_A/D_B$. Dynamic Monte Carlo simulation confirm our theoreticalpredictions.",

Thus, by controlling the local density of photonic states Forstercoupled systems can be manipulated and analyzed without the need to physicallyseparate donor and acceptor chromophores for individual analysis, which is ofinterest, for example, for oligomeric reef coral fluorescent proteins.",

We identify classical bulgesand pseudobulges morphologically with HST images in a sample of nearbygalaxies.

(2)Bulge type also predicts where the galaxy lies in other (bimodal) globalstructural parameters.

This principle in its simplest formasserts that the jet prolongation map $j^r:C^\\infty(M,E)\\to\\Gamma(J^r(M,E))$,defined on the space of smooth maps from a compact manifold M to a Euclideanspace E and with target the space of smooth sections of the jet bundle$J^r(M,E)$, is a cohomology isomorphism when restricted to certain\"nonsingular\" subsets (these are defined in terms of a certain subset$R\\subseteq J^r(M,E)$). Our generalization then puts this theorem in a moregeneral setting of topological $C^\\infty(M,R)$-modules.

This work is a straightforward extension of Ostriker(1999) who studied the case of a straight-line trajectory. The circular orbitcauses the bending of the wake in the background medium along the orbit,forming a long trailing tail. The wake distribution is thus asymmetric, givingrise to the drag forces in both opposite (azimuthal) and lateral (radial)directions to the motion of the perturber, although the latter does notcontribute to orbital decay much. For subsonic motion, the density wake with aweak tail is simply a curved version of that in Ostriker and does not exhibitthe front-back symmetry. The resulting drag force in the opposite direction isremarkably similar to the finite-time, linear-trajectory counterpart. On theother hand, a supersonic perturber is able to overtake its own wake, possiblymultiple times, and develops a very pronounced tail. The supersonic tailsurrounds the perturber in a trailing spiral fashion, enhancing the perturbeddensity at the back as well as far front of the perturber. We provide thefitting formulae for the drag forces as functions of the Mach number, whoseazimuthal part is surprisingly in good agreement with the Ostriker's formula,provided Vp t=2 Rp, where Vp and Rp are the velocity and orbital radius of theperturber, respectively.",

We show that atleast 40% of NGC 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the redgiant branch to avoid the flash, and therefore did not convert helium intocarbon-oxygen in their core. Such increased mass loss in the evolution of theprogenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extremehorizontal branch in the CMD. This unique stellar evolutionary channel alsonaturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 Gyr) for NGC6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium core white dwarfs in this clusterwill cool ~3 times slower than carbon-oxygen core stars and therefore thecorrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact ~7 Gyr, consistent with the wellmeasured main-sequence turnoff age. These results provide direct empiricalevidence that mass loss is much more efficient in high metallicity environmentsand therefore may be critical in interpreting the ultraviolet upturn inelliptical galaxies.",

Using the accurate X-ray position allowed bySwift/XRT data, we pinpointed the optical counterpart, a M2 III star. Besides,the combined use of the spectral information afforded by XRT and INTEGRAL/IBISshows that the 0.5-200 keV spectrum of this source can be described with anabsorbed Comptonization model, usually found in LMXBs and, in particular, inSyXBs. No long-term (days to months) periodicities are detected in the IBISdata. The time coverage afforded by XRT reveals shot-noise variability typicalof accreting Galactic X-ray sources, but is not good enough to explore thepresence of X-ray short-term (seconds to hours) oscillations in detail. Byusing the above information, we infer important parameters for this source suchas its distance (about 3.7 kpc) and X-ray luminosity (about 1.4e35 erg/s in the0.5-200 keV band), and we give a description for this system (typical of SyXBs)in which a compact object (possibly a neutron star) accretes from the wind ofits M-type giant companion.

The sense of the observedasymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in theouter layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic andsignificantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of ourobservations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule isgravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggestthat the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of theouter layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state nearhydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internalsupport. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsationwould be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule dueto the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for thedouble-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinctionmaps.

The positional astrometric precision was found to be limited only bythe accuracy of the determination of the star photocentre, which is typically200-300 microarcsec per single measurement for bright unsaturated starsB=18-19. Several statistical tests have shown that at time-scales of 1-4 nightsthe residual noise in measured positions is essentially a white noise with nosystematic instrumental signature and no significant deviation from a Gaussiandistribution. Some evidence of a good astrometric quality of the VLT for framesseparated by two years has also been found. Our data show that the VLT withFORS1/2 cameras can be effectively used for astrometric observations ofplanetary microlensing events and other applications where a high accuracy isrequired, that is expected to reach 30-40 microarcsec for a series of 50 frames(one hours with R filter).",

Further observations using {\\em  Swift}, Gemini-North, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory refined the sourceposition and confirmed the absence of any optical counterpart to an X-ray tooptical flux ratio of F_X/F_V > 8700 (3 sigma). Interpretation of 1RXSJ141256.0+792204 -- which we have dubbed Calvera -- as a typical X-ray-dimisolated neutron star would place it at z ~ 5.1 kpc above the Galactic disk --in the Galactic halo -- implying that it either has an extreme space velocity(v_z >~ 5100 km s-1) or has failed to cool according to theoreticalpredictions. Interpretations as a persistent anomalous X-ray pulsar, or a``compact central object'' present conflicts with these classes' typicalproperties. We conclude the properties of Calvera are most consistent withthose of a nearby (80 to 260 pc) radio pulsar, similar to the radio millisecondpulsars of 47 Tuc, with further observations required to confirm thisclassification.

It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basicclosure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrixexponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by itstranspose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown toprovide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow areinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.The basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated byimplementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropicturbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation ofentirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinearscrambling' terms.

Measuring the local concentration of such aprotein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement ofposition within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively,position determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamentallimits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradientsdue to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus ongradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type havebeen experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biologysettings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, greatprecision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers.As a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositelydirected gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positionalprecision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averagingtime, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required forhigh precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate theexistence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision ismaximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of theconcentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraintson the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in variouscontexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a singlecell.",

Pure HCOOH ices deposited at 15 K and145 K are studied, as well as binary and tertiary mixtures containing H2O, CO,CO2 and CH3OH.

We define the photometric central time of the transit thatis equivalent to the transit of a fixed photocenter. This point orbits thebarycenter, and leads to the photometric transit timing variations. The exactvalue of $TTV_p$ depends on the ratio of the density, the mass, and the size ofthe satellite and the planet. Since two of those parameters are independent, areliable estimation of the density ratio leads to an estimation of the size andthe mass of the exomoon. Upper estimations of the parameters are possible inthe case when an upper limit of $TTV_p$ is known. In case the density ratiocannot be estimated reliably, we propose an approximation with assuming equaldensities. The presented photocenter $TTV_p$ analysis predicts the size of thesatellite better than the mass. We simulated transits of the Earth-Moon systemin front of the Sun. The estimated size and mass of the Moon are 0.020Earth-mass and 0.274 Earth-size if equal densities are assumed. This result iscomparable to the real values within a factor of 2.

We used helioseismic holography to image the source of seismicwaves emitted into the solar interior from the site of the flare. Acousticegression power maps at 3 and 6 mHz with a 2 mHz bandpass reveal a compactacoustic source strongly correlated with impulsive hard X-ray andvisible-continuum emission along the penumbral neutral line separating the twomajor opposing umbrae in the $\\delta$-configuration sunspot that predominatesAR10720. The acoustic emission signatures were directly aligned with both hardX-ray and visible continuum emission that emanated during the flare. Thevisible continuum emission is estimated at $2.0 \\times 10^{23}$ J,approximately 500 times the seismic emission of $\\sim 4 \\times 10^{20}$ J. Theflare of 2005 January 15 exhibits the same close spatial alignment between thesources of the seismic emission and impulsive visible continuum emission asprevious flares, reinforcing the hypothesis that the acoustic emission may bedriven by heating of the low photosphere. However, it is a major exception inthat there was no signature to indicate the inclusion of protons in theparticle beams thought to supply the energy radiated by the flare. Thecontinued strong coincidence between the sources of seismic emission andimpulsive visible continuum emission in the case of a proton-deficientwhite-light flare lends substantial support to the ``back -- warming''hypothesis, that the low photosphere is significantly heated by intense Balmerand Paschen continuum-edge radiation from the overlying chromosphere inwhite-light flares.",

The inner shock of this shell reachesand bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initiallyalmost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting ofthe material in the shock-bounded shell, with a power-law density profile thatat late times approaches a logarithmic slope of -2 even in non-collapsingcases. The resulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius <0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like (BE-like) profile, although it has significantdynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating and confined by theram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuouslyin mass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventuallyreaches an effective Jeans mass, at which time the core begins to collapse.Thus, there is necessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core andthe onset of its collapse, but this is not due to the dissipation of itsinternal turbulence as it is often believed. These results suggest thatpre-stellar cores may approximate Bonnor-Ebert structures which are however ofvariable mass and may or may not experience gravitational collapse, inqualitative agreement with the large observed frequency of cores with BE-likeprofiles.",

Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li forMg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone.This means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect ofdecrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possiblereason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band whileelectrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of theupper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tcshow a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite ofmuch different substitution level.

The Universe is considered aclosed system and allowed to expand adiabatically from the epoch when QSOsfirst ionized the IGM (5 <= z_on <= 20). The average kinetic energy of a gas iscalculated in the region where the gas transitions from relativistic tonon-relativistic behavior. All of the above measurements are then used todetermine the thermal history of the IGM in the redshift range 2.5 <= z <=z_on. The hot IGM is assumed to inverse Compton scatter photons from the CosmicMicrowave Background (CMBR) and consequently distort the CMBR as seen at thepresent epoch. The temperature of the IGM at z=2.5 and the epoch z_on areadjusted, within the constraints defined above, to give the best overallagreement with published data on the temperature of the IGM. We find that themodel of the IGM proposed here does not grossly distort the CMBR, and in factagrees quite closely with the preliminary results from the Cosmic BackgroundExplorer (COBE) satellite. However, our model of the IGM cannot explain theobserved cosmic x ray background.  This paper was originally written in 1990. It was never submitted forpublication.",

It specifically allows us to extract the effective depthof the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of therf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion ofthe trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motionand the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes,however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur atlarge trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume.In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude.

We show that both models allow asignificant softening but, in the first case the bulk modulus is mainlydependent on the density, while in the mixed phase model it also stronglydepends on the temperature.

The sense of the observedasymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in theouter layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic andsignificantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of ourobservations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule isgravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggestthat the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of theouter layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state nearhydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internalsupport. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsationwould be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule dueto the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for thedouble-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinctionmaps.

Significant structural and evolutionary differencesoccur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds inpure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of suchclouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steeptemperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because theconduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes thevelocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that thetimescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of thecloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect ofheat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and lessmassive clouds.

The variability significance is comparedto the optical, mid-IR, and X-ray properties of the sources. We find that 26%of all AGN candidates (either X-ray- or mid-IR-selected) are optical variables.The fraction of optical variables increases to 51% when considering sourceswith soft X-ray band ratios. For the mid-IR AGN candidates which havemultiwavelength SEDs, we find optical variability for 64% of those classifiedwith SEDs like Broad Line AGNs. While mostly unobscured AGN appear to have themost significant optical variability, some of the more obscured AGNs are alsoobserved as variables. In particular, we find two mid-IR power law-selected AGNcandidates without X-ray emission that display optical variability, confirmingtheir AGN nature.",

More specifically, does there exist aclass of V-Langevin equations with long-range (algebraic) velocity temporalcorrelation, that leads to a time-fractional superdiffusive process? The answeris always affirmative in one dimension. It is always negative in twodimensions: any algebraically decaying temporal velocity correlation (with aGaussian spatial correlation) produces a normal diffusive process. Generalconditions relating the diffusive nature of the process to the temporalexponent of the Lagrangian velocity correlation (in Corrsin approximation) arederived.",

In this work, we first assume that the power of the additivenoise is known and we find the optimum linear approximation of LLRs in thesense of maximum achievable transmission rate on the channel. The maximumachievable rate under this linear LLR calculation is almost equal to themaximum achievable rate under true LLR calculation.

Wedemonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear,nonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations that the equilibrium-tide formulaworks extremely well for stars of mass <1.4 Msun with thick surface convectionzones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform tothe equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations $\\ga$10times larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar massesconsidered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone byadapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating whitedwarfs. Compared to other sources of periodic variability, the ellipsoidallightcurve has a distinct dependence on time and system parameters. We suggestthat ellipsoidal oscillations induced by giant planets may be detectable fromas many as ~100 of the 10^5 Kepler target stars. (Abridged)",

The study of diffusion on such networks ismotivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronizationproblems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport onnetworks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a richphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context ofrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, andin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to themotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established thatin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small densityof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interactiontopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In somecases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in theEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. Thisbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, wherethe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of anaive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are alsoconfirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of thenetwork Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework forthe relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finitenetworks.

Specifically, we propose aphysical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions amongnodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs codingarithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes useof the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) wavesfor equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission andstraightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. Morespecifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double thatof traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higherthan 0dB).

Two scenarios areconsidered for the network scaling law: (i) when each cognitive transmitteruses constant power to communicate with a cognitive receiver at a boundeddistance away, and (ii) when each cognitive transmitter scales its poweraccording to the distance to a considered primary user, allowing the cognitivetransmitter-receiver distances to grow. Using single-hop transmission, suitablefor cognitive devices of opportunistic nature, we show that, in both scenarios,with path loss larger than 2, the cognitive network throughput scales linearlywith the number of cognitive users. We then explore the radius of a primaryexclusive region void of cognitive transmitters. We obtain bounds on thisradius for a given primary outage constraint. These bounds can help in thedesign of a primary network with exclusive regions, outside of which cognitiveusers may transmit freely.

These different tracers must be compared indifferent environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deducedfrom millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in ourGalaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of thenearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deducedfrom millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma rayanalysis and trace the total mass of the clouds.

Functionallysimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations andcapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any ofthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolutionfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficientlylarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selectionpressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show thatproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towardshigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolvegreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance bothmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness andstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can bequantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutralnetwork.  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the generaltendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability inhighly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contributeto the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria thatexist in large populations.",

We find that only the vzw scaling reproduces the observedz~2 MZR's slope, amplitude, and scatter. Comparing our fully three-dimensionalsimulations with a simple one-zone chemical evolution model, we find that theMZR can be understood in terms of three parameters: (1) The equilibriummetallicity Z_eq=y*SFR/ACC (where y=true yield), reflecting the enrichmentbalance between star formation rate SFR and gas accretion rate ACC; (2) thedilution time t_d=M_g/ACC, representing the timescale for a galaxy to return toZ_eq after a metallicity-perturbing interaction; and (3) the blowout massM_blowout, which is the galaxy stellar mass above which winds can escape itshalo. When outflows with mass loading factor MLF are present, galaxies belowM_blowout obey Z_eq = y/(1+MLF), while above M_blowout, Z_eq->y.

Here we explore this contamination process by simulatingthe interactions of an inward migrating planet with a disc of planetesimalinterior to its orbit. The results show the percentage of planetesimals thatfall on the star. We identified the dependence of the planet's eccentricity($e_p$) and time scale of migration ($\\tau$) on the rate of infallingplanetesimals. For very fast migrations ($\\tau=10^2$yr and $\\tau=10^3$yr) thereis no capture in mean motion resonances, independently of the value of $e_p$.Then, due to the planet's migration the planetesimals suffer close approacheswith the planet and more than 80% of them are ejected from the system. For slowmigrations ($\\tau=10^5$yr and $\\tau=10^6$yr) the percentage of collisions withthe planet decrease with the increase of the planet's eccentricity. For $e_p=0$and $e_p=0.1$ most of the planetesimals were captured in the 2:1 resonance andmore than 65% of them collided with the star. Whereas migration of a Jupitermass planet to very short pericentric distances requires unrealistic high discmasses, these requirements are much smaller for smaller migrating planets. Oursimulations for a slowly migrating 0.1 $M_{\\rm Jupiter}$ planet, even demandinga possible primitive disc three times more massive than a primitive solarnebula, produces maximum [Fe/H] enrichments of the order of 0.18 dex.

Our targets are 74 F-M dwarfs in the youngstellar associations Eta Cha, TW Hydrae, Beta Pic, and Tuc-Hor, spanning agesfrom 6 to 30 Myr. While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistentwith pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromosphericemission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, wesee a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadilyfrom the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an ageindicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in thetotal sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars.This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr,possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disklifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation isflat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linearcorrelation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young starsgenerate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way frommain-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo.By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for asubset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17} Myr for theEta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.Thus we conclude that stellar radii from evolutionary models by Baraffe et al.(1998) are in agreement with the observed radii within +-15%.

This is donefor a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions forsome of the nonrenormalizable couplings.

A strong soft excess below 1 keV is observed in the time-averagedHETG spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermalmodel. The flux variability at low energies indicates that the origin of thesoft excess cannot be entirely ascribed to the circumnuclear diffuse emission,detected by chandra on scales of 20-30 arcsec (22-33 kpc). A narrow (sigma<90eV) Fe Kalpha line (with EW< 100 eV) is observed by the chandra HEG. Similarvalues for the line parameters are measured by the rxte PCA, suggesting thatthe contribution from a broad line component is negligible. The fact that theexposure is split into two observations taken three days apart allows us toinvestigate the spectral and temporal evolution of the source on differenttimescales.

We then follow with a complete supersymmetryanalysis, yielding 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 BPS configurations, respectively (where inthe last step we take the Hopf fibration of S^3). The 1/8 BPS geometries, whichhave an S^3 isometry and are time-fibered over a six-dimensional base, aredetermined by solving a non-linear equation for the Kahler metric on the base.Similarly, the 1/4 BPS configurations have an S^3 x S^1 isometry and afour-dimensional base, whose Kahler metric obeys another non-linear,Monge-Ampere type equation.  Despite the non-linearity of the problem, we develop a universal bubbling AdSdescription of these geometries by focusing on the boundary conditions whichensure their regularity. In the 1/8 BPS case, we find that the S^3 cycleshrinks to zero size on a five-dimensional locus inside the six-dimensionalbase. Enforcing regularity of the full solution requires that the interior of asmooth, generally disconnected five-dimensional surface be removed from thebase. The AdS_5 x S^5 ground state corresponds to excising the interior of anS^5, while the 1/8 BPS excitations correspond to deformations (includingtopology change) of the S^5 and/or the excision of additional droplets from thebase.

Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity ofstellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are opticallythin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empiricalmass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can beoptically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''impacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)model atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account forclumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumpsreduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergentspectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that theoptically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PVresonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken intoaccount. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line andrecombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumpingmodeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha linein O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of opticallythick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects.

Precluding the SNRof the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurementsrequired for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widelydealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there wasmotivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derivethese bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithmindependent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In thisdirection we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds tothe probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortioncriteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upperbounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacitygoes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means thatdisproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Ournext main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity onsensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensingdiversity is related to the effective \\emph{coverage} of a sensor with respectto the field.

We detect NH3(1,1) emissiontoward all 21 regions and 24 GHz continuum emission toward 12 of the regions,including 6 with no reported 8 GHz continuum counterparts. In total, we findthe 21 regions contain 41 NH3(1,1) cores. We extract characteristic spectra forevery core at each of the NH3 transitions and present both integrated intensitymaps and channel maps for each region. The NH3(4,4)+(5,5) emission is alwaysunresolved and found at the maser position indicating that the methanol masersare found at the warmest part of the core. We observe large asymmetries in theNH3(1,1) hyperfine line profiles and conclude this is due to a number of dense,small clumps within the beam. We derive properties of the ionised gas and findthe 24 GHz continuum sources not detected at 8 GHz are always coincident withboth NH3 and methanol masers in contrast to those detected at 8 + 24 GHz whichare generally offset from the methanol masers. We investigate the possibilitythat the former may be hyper-compact HII regions. Finally, we separate thecores into five groups, based on their association with NH3, methanol maser andcontinuum emission. From the different physical properties of the cores in thegroups, we discuss the possibility that these groups may represent cores atdifferent evolutionary stages of the massive star formation process.",

The suggected method is fundamentallydictinct from all existing methods that extract freshwater from air. All otherindustrial methods extract water from a saline water source (in most cases fromseawater). This new method may be used at any point in the Earth except PolarZones. It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawateris not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method isvery environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) thefirst variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tubein a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) inthe second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface.In the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing airflow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.  The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount.Moreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.)and can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that waythe freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater isinjected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heaterproduces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generationplant. The offered electricity installation in 100 - 200 times cheaper than anycommon electric plant of equivalent output.

Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflectingthat option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Optionpricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how closethe model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use,and those inputs are usually not observable. We provide three alternativeframeworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating parameteruncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our methodswith classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no optionsmarket established. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments forwhich there is not an options market, as well as a methodological tool toaccount for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.",

Themethod is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equationformalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method ina chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phaseand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small numberof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbondioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulationis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but nosurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flator rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, Oand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under theconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to asignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which inturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surfacechemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermaldesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assortedmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allowsdetermination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. Themantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other thana slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreementwith observations.",

In thispaper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by consideringa very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number oflow affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites,corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip.We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modesby considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walksalong the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation andthen re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; anda hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and thenre-associates at a faster rate than the jumper.

Intheir seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\\itcycling problem} as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interestingfor cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem,mainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffrewhich shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This resultalso holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.  On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usuallysolved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets(left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use rightnormal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy searchproblem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may thinkthat even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a smallright-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular caseof rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS ofa given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, theisomorphism being defined using iterated cycling.

In today's interconnected world, network protocols play a crucial role in facilitating communication and data exchange between different systems. However, the complexity and variety of these protocols make them prone to vulnerabilities and implementation errors, which can lead to security breaches and system failures. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the power of programming languages to improve the robustness of network application protocol implementations.Our approach focuses on two key aspects: formal specification and static analysis. Firstly, we advocate for the use of formal specifications to precisely define the behavior and constraints of network protocols. By providing a rigorous and unambiguous specification, developers can have a clear understanding of the expected protocol behavior, facilitating error detection and prevention. Secondly, we employ static analysis techniques to analyze the source code of protocol implementations. By performing rigorous code analysis, we can detect potential vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or input validation errors, before the protocols are deployed in production environments.To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a case study on a widely used network application protocol.

ULXs are a class of X-ray sources characterized by their extraordinarily high luminosities, reaching values of about 10^40 ergs/s. We utilize a sample of ULXs from various sources, including starburst galaxies and bulgeless disk galaxies, to conduct a comparative analysis of different spectral models.Our results reveal significant variations in the estimated luminosities of ULXs when different spectral models are employed. Specifically, we find that the choice of spectral model has a substantial impact on the derived luminosity values. This dependence arises primarily due to the presence of complex physical processes and emission mechanisms within ULX systems.Furthermore, we identify two common spectral behaviors exhibited by ULXs. Firstly, certain ULXs in starburst galaxies exhibit a constant, hard power-law spectrum with no significant variation in the luminosity. Conversely, other ULXs, such as those observed in bulgeless disk galaxies, display a correlation between luminosity and the photon index of the power-law spectrum.To better understand the nature of ULX emission, we examine specific ULX systems in detail. For instance, the analysis of NGC 5204 X-1 suggests the influence of an accretion disk, with the X-ray luminosity positively correlated with the effective temperature of the disk. This finding aligns with observations in stellar-mass black hole X-ray binaries, indicating the presence of a more massive compact object in NGC 5204 X-1.Contrastingly, the disk model in IC 342 X-1 is ruled out, as its luminosity decreases with increasing temperature.

We perform numerical simulations and compare the results obtained using the generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law with those obtained without it. We also assess the impact of different physical parameters, such as magnetic field strength and line opacities, on the polarization transfer.Results. Our analysis demonstrates that unphysical source terms can significantly affect the degree and orientation of polarization in resonance line transfer. The generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law provides a means to correct for these effects and improve the accuracy of NLTE radiative transfer codes. We find that the impact of unphysical source terms depends on the specific physical conditions and the properties of the medium under investigation.Conclusions. The generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law presents an important tool for accurately modeling resonance line polarization transfer and for validating the performance of NLTE radiative transfer codes. By incorporating this law into simulations and codes, researchers can better determine the influence of unphysical source terms and enhance the reliability of their results. Further investigations are necessary to explore the full range of applications and implications of the generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law in the study of stellar atmospheres and magnetic fields.",

By considering noncommutative field theories on spacetime, which can be understood as (NC) phase spaces, we establish a correspondence between noncommutative electromagnetism and matrix models or large N field theories. This correspondence allows us to view noncommutative fields as master fields of large N matrices, providing insights into the underlying physics. Moreover, we show that noncommutative fields naturally define vector (tetrad) fields, leading to the emergence of a gravitational metric as an emergent geometry. We establish a parallel between this picture and the large N duality in string theory, highlighting the deep connections between noncommutative spacetime, electromagnetism, and gravity.

By considering the role of X-ray photoevaporation, we find that the observed range of X-ray luminosities for solar-type T-Tauri stars leads to the formation of vigorous disc winds and contributes to the diverse population of transition objects. Our model, assuming a viscosity parameter alpha = 2.5e-3, matches the current observations of disc lifetimes and accretion rates. Moreover, we present a diagnostic diagram based on accretion rates versus inner hole sizes, demonstrating that many observed accreting and non-accreting transition discs can be explained by X-ray photoevaporation.

The presence of smaller spherical particles as depletants in the mixture induces an attractive interaction between the rod-like particles, which leads to the formation of smectic phases. Smectic phases are characterized by the formation of layers with long-range positional and/or orientational order. We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the phase behavior and structural properties of the smectic phases in the presence of depletants. We investigate the effects of the depletant concentration, aspect ratio, and size ratio on the smectic order and the layer spacing. Our results show that the presence of depletants enhances the smectic order and reduces the layer spacing. We also analyze the density profiles and structure factors to characterize the layering and interlayer correlations in the smectic phases. The density profiles show a depletion layer near the boundaries of the smectic layers, which indicates the enhanced attraction between the rod-like particles induced by the depletants. We find that the phase boundaries between different smectic phases are shifted to higher aspect ratios with increasing depletant concentration. The structure factors show distinct peaks corresponding to the smectic order, and the depletant concentration affects the peak positions and the peak heights. In summary, our study provides insights into the depletion effects in smectic phases of hard rod-hard sphere mixtures and demonstrates the role of depletants in modifying the phase behavior and structural properties of these systems.",

Globular clusters are dense stellar systems containing thousands to millions of stars, and their mass function, which describes the distribution of masses in the cluster, is a fundamental quantity for understanding their formation and evolution. Using a combination of analytical modeling and numerical simulations, the authors explore the impact of stellar-dynamical evaporation on the shape of the mass function of GCs. The authors show that stellar-dynamical evaporation leads to a flattening of the mass function at the low-mass end, resulting in a deficit of low-mass stars compared to what would be expected from a simple power-law distribution. The study reveals that evaporation processes significantly alter the initial mass function, preferentially removing stars below a certain mass threshold. The precise mass threshold depends on the cluster's initial conditions, such as its total mass and initial stellar density. The removal of low-mass stars also leads to a loss of dynamical heating sources, which slows the cluster's expansion over time. This has implications for our understanding of the long-term survival of GCs and their ability to resist disruption in the galactic environment.

This article comprehensively analyzes the phenomenon and reveals that even strong fixed power is not enough to stabilize the interface in this specific situation. The author uses the combination of theoretical modeling, numerical simulation and statistical analysis to study dynamics of chaotic interface. The results show that the existence of the disease significantly affects the movement of the interface, which leads to irregular and unstable behaviors. Despite the use of strong clampy, the interface still cannot overcome the destructive effect of the disease, resulting in lack of stability. The results of the research challenged the hypothesis of the previous two -dimensional system of fixing forced obstacles. In addition, the study has determined various factors that lead to weakening the fixed force, including disorderly distribution and intensity, as well as the size and shape of the interface. This article also emphasizes the meaning of these discoveries to practical applications, such as material science and nanotechnology, where the stability and control of the interface are critical. Overall, this study highlights the limitations of strong fixing in the stable two -dimensional continuous interface. It provides valuable insights for the behavior of such interfaces, which helps to understand the impact of diseases in complex systems more deeply.

Using mathematical models, this model combines important ecological processes, such as the availability of nutrients and the interaction of the predator -capture. We observe the formation and spread of spiral waves in the float biological group.

The Abell 901/902 supercluster presents an advantageous setting for exploring the influence of large-scale structures on galaxy properties due to its abundant cluster environment and high galaxy density. A visual morphological classification scheme is employed to categorize galaxies into four primary morphological types: ellipticals, spirals, irregulars, and mergers. Subsequently, we analyze the morphological classifications in relation to the local galaxy density and proximity to massive clusters.Our findings disclose discernible trends in galaxy morphologies across diverse environments. Elliptical galaxies dominate the central regions of massive clusters, while spiral galaxies are mainly concentrated in lower density regions. Irregular galaxies exhibit a more dispersed distribution, implying that they are less affected by their immediate environment. Merging galaxies are primarily detected in close proximity to dense regions, indicating that interactions and mergers are more prevalent in such environments.Moreover, we conduct a quantitative analysis to measure the environmental effects on galaxy morphologies. We observe a strong correlation between local galaxy density and the fraction of elliptical galaxies, indicating that galaxy interactions and dynamical processes significantly contribute to the formation and evolution of ellipticals. Conversely, spiral galaxies demonstrate a weak correlation with density, suggesting that additional factors, such as gas accretion and secular evolution, contribute to their formation.Our results emphasize the intricate interplay between galaxy morphologies and the surrounding environment within the Abell 901/902 supercluster.",

Dark energy, a hypothetical frm of energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, remains an enigma in modern cоsmology. We propose that analyzing the lcal morphological fea𝚝ures of cosmic microwave backdrop (CMB) maps and radio galaxy distributions using steerable wavelets can provide valuable insights into the nature of dark energy. To achieve this, we emplоy a novel methodology that combines the concept of steerable wavelets with statistical measures such as the Minkowѕki functionals and multiscale entropy. Steerable wavelets offer a flexible framewоrk for analyzing the morphological properties of data at multiple scales and orientations. Thruogh correlation analysis, we aim to identify any potential correlations or patterns that could reveal the influence of dark energy on the large-scale structure of the universe. Ouⲅ prelіminary results indicate a promising correlation between specific local morphological measures in the WMAP and NVSS datasets, which suggests a potential link between the distribution of comsic microwave background anisotropies and the clustering of radio galaxies. This correlatioո suggests that dark energy might play a role in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe, influencing both the CB fluctuations and the formation of radio galaxies. Further investigations are ongoing to validate and refinery these initial findings. Overall, our study highlights the singificance of utilizing steerable wavelet analysis in probing dark energy and understanding the fundamental trait of the universe.",

The generated entangled state serves as the quantum channel with high efficiency. Then, by using quantum teleportation, the unknown quantum state encoded in the photonic qubit can be deterministically transferred to the atomic qubit with the help of the established quantum channel. The transferred quantum state is stored in the atomic quantum memory. Finally, by using the quantum channel again, the stored quantum state can be retrieved and delivered to the destination place.

The SM predicts a small amount of CP violation, which is sufficient to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. However, there are many theories beyond the SM that predict much larger amounts of CP violation. These theories can be tested by searching for CP violation in rare decays of particles.One of the most promising places to search for CP violation is in the decays of B mesons. B mesons are particles that contain a bottom quark and an antiquark. They can decay in a variety of ways, including decays that involve the emission of a pair of electrons or muons. The rates of these decays can be different for B mesons and their antiparticles, which would be a sign of CP violation.Another place to search for CP violation is in the decays of K mesons.

Marginal structural models (MSMs) provide a powerful framework for causal inference in longitudinal studies by explicitly considering the time-varying nature of exposures and confounding factors. However, traditional MSMs require strong assumptions, such as no unmeasured confounding and no selection bias.In this paper, we propose a new class of MSMs, called history-restricted MSMs, that relax these assumptions. History-restricted MSMs allow for unmeasured confounding and selection bias, but they require that the outcome be independent of past exposures and confounding factors conditional on the current exposure and past outcomes. We show that history-restricted MSMs can be used to estimate causal effects in a variety of settings, including studies with time-varying exposures, time-varying confounding factors, and studies with missing data. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm for fitting history-restricted MSMs.We demonstrate the use of history-restricted MSMs in two empirical applications. In the first application, we use history-restricted MSMs to estimate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on mortality in HIV-infected individuals. In the second application, we use history-restricted MSMs to estimate the effect of job training on earnings.Our results suggest that history-restricted MSMs are a promising new tool for causal inference in longitudinal studies.

The model is applied to the Crab pulsar, and the results are compared with the observed properties of the Crab giant pulses.

With eight epochs of astrometric measurements and 43 precise radial velocity measurements collected with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrograph, we determine the mass of the companion to be 9.06  0.50 M. The derived systemic properties indicate that the companion is close to the hydrogen-burning limit, suggesting that it is a massive exoplanet or a brown dwarf.

With 1.4 million Japanese patent data sets awarded from 1976 to 2016, we built a joint application network, where the node represents a joint application between patent applications and margins. We then analyze the spatial distribution of nodes and edges in the network. Our results show that the joint application network is highly gathering, and the areas of densely connected are corresponding to the main technical fields. We also found that the network has a layered structure and a large joint application cluster is surrounded by smaller clusters. These discoveries show that jointly applying for technology diffusion in Japanese companies and regions plays an important role.",

        "text": "[Assistant]: In this article, we proposed a novel explanation of the final state interaction between quantum measurement as a quantum system and a macro external system. We believe that this explanation can solve several conceptual problems through traditional Copenhagen explanations, such as the collapse and measurement of the wave function. We also show that our explanation is consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics. We first review the traditional Copenhagen's explanation of quantum measurement. In this explanation, the measured behavior caused the wave function of the quantum system to collapse, and it is said that the system is one of the observed observed feature states. However, there are several conceptual problems. For example, it is unclear how the wave function collapses immediately, and it is not clear why the measurement process should cause the system to be located in one of the observed feature states. We have proposed a new explanation of quantum measurement to avoid these conceptual issues. In our explanation, measurement behaviors will not cause the wave function of the quantum system to collapse. Instead, the quantum system interacts with the macro external system, and this interaction causes the external system to be in one of the observed feature states. The status of the external system reveals the state of the quantum system. Our explanation is consistent with the prediction of quantum mechanics. We show that our explanation can reproduce all the predictions of traditional Copenhagen's traditional interpretation, but the situation does not have conceptual issues related to the explanation. We believe that our interpretation of quantum measurement is a major progress in understanding this basic process.",

Dark energy is a kind of energy form, which is considered to be the cause of acceleration of the expansion of the universe. On the other hand, gravity is one of the four basic forces of nature, and is the attractiveness between quality objects. In this article, we will discuss the relationship between black energy and gravity and discuss certain meanings of its interaction. It is believed that dark energy accounts for 68 % of the total energy of the universe, while gravity accounts for only about 5 %. This means that the dark energy is the main form of energy in the universe, and it is the reason why it accelerates expansion. The existence of dark energy is inferred from the observation results of the distant supernova, which shows that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. On the other hand, gravity is one of the four basic forces of nature, and is the attractiveness between quality objects. Gravity is a kind of good power, described by Einstein's general theory. However, general relativity does not explain the existence of dark energy or its impact on the universe. One of the meanings between dark energy and gravity is that the expansion of the universe will eventually become so rapid that the galaxy will be torn. This is called \"big crack\". It is expected to have a major crack in about 22 billion years. Another meaning of the interaction between dark energy and gravity is that the universe will eventually end with \"heat death\". In this case, the universe will expand to a certain degree, so that all material and energy will be so thin, so that any further interaction will not happen. It is expected that heat death will occur within about 10 years.",

The non-Markovian SLE is derived from the generalized master equation for continuous-time random walks and incorporates the memory effects of the underlying dynamics. The Markovian representation of the non-Markovian SLE is obtained by introducing a fictitious auxiliary Markovian process, which generalizes the CTRW scheme. The solution of the non-Markovian SLE is expressed in terms of the Green's function of the fictitious Markovian process. The formalism is illustrated by considering two examples: (i) the fractional diffusion equation and (ii) the non-Markovian relaxation of a two-level system. The results demonstrate the potential of the non-Markovian SLE and its Markovian representation for describing non-Markovian processes in various fields of science.",

Thermal phase curves, i.e., the variation of the planet's thermal emission as a function of orbital phase, are a poweJful tool to probK the day-to-night lemperature difference and the day-to-night heat redistribution efficiency. So ar, only a handful of hot Jupiters have been observed at thermal waLelengths to construct their thermal phase curves. We present mid-infrared (4.5 \\mum) phase curves of the oht Jupiter WASP-121b observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Teh phase curves show significant variations with the amplitude of similar to 20%. By fitting the phase curves with a simple model, we constrin the day-to-night temperature difference and the day-to-night heat redistribuXtion efficiency of WASP-121b. W find that the day-to-Aight temperature contrast is similar to 2,000 K, and about 10% of the dayside energy is transported to the nightside.

We also proving that photon correlation can be used to violate the CHSH inequality, which provides further empirical for the nonlocality of quantum mechanics. The significance of our findings is that we demonstrate that a violation of Bell's inequality is not vitale for a violation of local realism. This has important implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics, as it exposures that local realism can got violated without requiring the existence of nonlocal correlations.",

We investigate how a magnetar, a highly magnetized neutron star, can stroll collimated outflows that are consistent with the observational propеrties of GRBs. Methods:We perform axisymmetric, mɑgnetohydrodynamic simulations in which a rapidly rotating magnetar is embedded in a stellar envelope.

This paper outlines a computational approach to analyzing symmetries in differential geometry through prolongations. Prolongations are operations that extend geometric objects to higher-dimensional spaces in a systematic way. By extending differential geometric objects in this manner, one can exploit the intrinsic symmetries inherent in their underlying structure. The authors develop algorithms for systematically computing prolongations of geometric structures up to arbitrary order. These algorithms build on the methods of exterior differential systems and provide programmers with tools for implementing prolongations computationally. The algorithms are demonstrated on simple examples from mechanics to illustrate their use.By making prolongations amenable to computation, one gains new capabilities for exploring symmetries algorithmically. Potential applications include automating the derivation of conservation laws in analytical mechanics, as well as investigating geometric patterns in high-energy physics. The developed prolongation algorithms establish a framework that researchers can build on to tackle open problems at the intersection of differential geometry and computation.To validate the computational prolongation approach, its results are compared to known prolongations calculated by hand. Excellent agreement is found zwischen den berechneten und bekannten Ergebnissen. Finally, avenues for future work are discussed, such as optimizing the algorithms and applying them to problems of current interest in geometry and physics.

Tests were conducted on soil samples with known bulk densities between 1.0 to 1.8 g/cm^3 that were subjected to controlled vibrations. The results showed that conductivity fluctuations increased with higher levels of vibration intensity and inversely correlated with soil bulk density. An empirical correlation was derived between vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation and bulk density that could estimate bulk density with 87% accuracy. The proposed method allows rapid in-field measurement of bulk density without disturbing the soil structure. Further tests on different soil types demonstrated the robustness and consistency of this vibration-based measurement approach. This study suggests vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation has potential for continuous non-destructive monitoring of changes in soil bulk density over time related to factors like compaction or soil remediation activities.",

In this article, we study radiative breaking of various symmetries in models where the neutrino mass matrix does not feature strong hierarchies among its elements. We consider Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries and discuss how they can be broken spontaneously via loops to account for small but non-degenerate neutrino masses. The symmetries forbid tree-level mass terms but allow couplings to additional scalar and fermion fields that trigger symmetry breaking at higher orders. We examine the conditions under which each symmetry is effectively broken and find that certain Abelian and discrete symmetries can naturally accommodate experimental data on neutrino oscillations for a wide range of parameter values. Minimal extensions to the particle content and interactions are necessary to realise the breaking. Our models demonstrate that radiative corrections provide a viable alternative to hierarchical approaches for neutrino mass generation in agreement with observations.",

This bound was extended to provide an upper bound, called the SM quantum information, on the Fisher information of multi-parameter families of states. Some properties of the SM quantum information are then investigated. In particular, the authors analyze it in light of previous work characterizing metrics on the space of density matrices. It is shown that the SM quantum information is not actually a well-defined metric due to dependencies on phase choices of eigenvectors. To address this, a new metric called CL is defined as the lower bound among SM quantum informations.

Our mass function indicates an overall density of active black holes of (3.5 ± 1.2) × 10−3 Mpc−3 for masses between 106−1010 solar masses, with a logarithmic slope of -0.45 ± 0.08.

Flux cancellation at the boundary between these ephemeral regions and the leading spot polarity inverted the polarity from positive to negative, creating a new magnetic polarity of -1500 G.

In this paper, we analyze the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on graphs where the average degree of the nodes grows slowly with the number of nodes. It is shown that under certain conditions on the growth rate of the average degree, Gibbs sampling will rapidly explore the state space. These conditions allow for graphs that are sparse on average but locally dense. Numerical experiments on a stochastic block model verify that Gibbs sampling can quickly draw samples that are approximately independent even when the graph is not locally tree-like.

Using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we follow the collapse and interaction of primordial gas clouds from redshift 30 to z  10. The simulations model the cooling of the gas by collisional excitation and ionization of hydrogen and helium, and include a simple model for the formation of the first generation of stars. We identify overdensities that exceed the threshold for collapse and analyze how they evolve over time. Many of the initial overdensities fail to become fully virialized as they interact with the surrounding material. However, some regions grow in mass and density by accretion and mergers to form the first self-gravitating systems. We study how virialization depends on the mass and formation history of each system. We examine when these systems first reach an approximate equilibrium between their gravitational potential and internal kinetic energy. The simulations show that full virialization typically occurs around redshift 15 for structures with masses greater than 108 M. Future work will focus on identifying the properties and subsequent evolution of these first virialized protogalaxy structures. The results of this study provide new insights into the physical process by which the first galaxies assembled in the early universe.",

Our experimental results show that in the microwave absorption spectrum, the microwave absorption spectrum that can be corresponding to the surface state electronic system is different from the surface state electronic system.

For a long time, scientists have been arguing whether these holes have emerged as early as the galaxy evolution. This study aims to better understand the origin of the hole by analyzing the data from the Star Gas and stars from several nearby galaxies. It was initially discovered that there was a long time in the history of galaxies, and some of them had observed for hundreds of millions of years after the formation of galaxies. However, other observation results reveal the complex mode of new star formation around some holes, which means that these gaps have recently appeared through the star activities and feedback effects through the star activities in galaxies. In order to help delete these possibilities, numerical simulation is the evolutionary interaction between analog galaxy, star cluster and interstellar media. The simulation results temporarily support the two cases of different conditions and time range in galaxy life. It is still necessary to further model work to fully capture all the physical processes that play a role. It is more far away. The observation of the telescope of young galaxies should provide other data to test the original or short -term nature of the hole. Solving this \"egg and hen\" problem will understand the periodic connection between the galaxy and star formation in the universe time.",

The layout is based on the filling space curve, and the curve maps the two -dimensional indexing space of the grid to the one -dimensional array in a local and continuous manner. Analysis shows that the model has reached the best cache performance and does not require cache size knowledge. The performance was evaluated in different cache size.

In this work, we developed an annular gap acceleration model to help address gamma-ray emission from pulsars. Our model proposes that particle acceleration occurs in annular gaps forming along magnetic field lines extending from the neutron star surface to the light cylinder in the outer magnetosphere. Within these gaps, magnetic field curvature and plasma effects are thought to sufficiently accelerate charged particles. We numerically simulated electric fields and traced particle trajectories to investigate acceleration processes in the gaps. Our simulations indicate primary electrons and positrons can gain energies exceeding 1 GeV for typical pulsar parameters within the gaps. We then considered inverse Compton scattering and curvature radiation from these high-energy particles in strong magnetic fields as potential emission mechanisms for the observed pulsed gamma rays. Synthetic light curves and spectra generated from our model show good agreement with present gamma-ray observations of several pulsars in key areas like pulse profiles and spectral cutoffs.

We analyze UV photometric observatiоns of galaxies in the local Universe from the GALEX All-Sky Survey to estimate ѕtar formation rates (SFRs) based on the UV luminosity. The GALEX dataset provides UV observations of over 50,000 galaxies within 200 Mpc, allowing us to st udy star formation across a broad range of galaxy types and masses. We ԁiscuss various methods for converting UV luminosity to SFR and compare the results to SFR measurementѕ from H-alpha and infrared observations. Our SFRs based on UV luminosity are overall consonant with other tracers but shоw more variation for low-mass, low SFR galaxies. We examine how SFR scales with kеy galaxy properties like stellar mass, morphology, and environment. Across multiple environments, we unearthed a relation between stellar mass and specific SFR. Less massive galaxies typically have higher specific SRFs. Using group catalogs, we analyze how SFR deрends on a galaxy's position within its dark issue halo and proximity to neighboring galaxies. On average, satellite galaxies have reduced SFRs than centrals of the same stellar mass.

High-resolution spectra were collected from a sample of 15 stars, and the abundances of hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, and iron were determined using a spectrum synthesis technique. The results show that the stars exhibit significant enrichment in nitrogen and magnesium, and to a lesser extent in aluminum and silicon, relative to solar values. The abundances of oxygen and iron are found to be marginally consistent with solar values. The observed abundance patterns are consistent with predictions from models of AGB nucleosynthesis, but discrepancies in the case of some elements and individual stars suggest that additional processes may be at play. The implications of these findings for our understanding of AGB evolution and the chemical enrichment of the galaxy are discussed.",

We find that the PAH strength is positively correlated with the ISRF intensity, indicating that the PAH population is influenced by the radiation field.

The analysis of observation data from ball -shaped clusters reveals the large amount of photocopy, which challenges the conventional concept of galaxy chemistry. We found that the self -enhancement process driven by the advanced nuclear reaction in the spherical cluster plays a vital role in the production of the optical nucleus. The observed abundance mode indicates the delayed enrichment mechanism, which produces the optical core in the later stage of galaxy evolution. The meaning we find is discussed in the context of the hierarchical assembly of galaxies and the formation of spherical clusters. The observation of the abundance provides a unique constraint on the nuclear synthetic model, which can be used to improve our understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies. Our research shows that the importance of self -enhanced scenarios from the observation data from spherical clusters is considered.

However, the SZ effect is not a direct measurement of the quality of the cluster, but the proxy of calibration using simulation or observation results. In this article, we propose a new method to calibrate the SZ effect using the basic plane of the Galaxy cluster. Basic plane is the quality of clusters, the tight correlation between size and temperature. By using this plane, we can calibrate the SZ effect and measure the quality of the cluster with high accuracy and low scattering.

Our results reveal a non-monotonic behavior in the tunneling conductance as a function of the insulating barrier thickness, with a pronounced peak at an optimum barrier thickness. This peak is attributed to the resonant tunneling effect, where the energy of the incident electrons matches the energy of the electrons in the superconducting gap.We also examine the effect of doping on the tunneling conductance and find that it significantly impacts the overall behavior. Doping the graphene layer with either holes or electrons leads to a suppression of the tunneling conductance, with a more pronounced effect for hole doping. This suppression is attributed to the reduced density of states in the superconducting gap due to the doping.Furthermore, we study the effect of applying an external magnetic field on the tunneling conductance and observe significant modifications in the behavior. Our results show that in the presence of a magnetic field, the tunneling conductance exhibits oscillations as a function of the barrier thickness, with a period corresponding to half the magnetic flux quantum.

To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel approach that views quantum mechanics as a theory defined on a Hilbert manifold, which encompasses all possible states of a system. This approach facilitates a more adaptable and dynamic description of quantum systems and gives rise to the principle of functional relativity, which asserts that the laws of physics should be independent of the choice of background space-time. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to several examples, including the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom.

We first introduce a set of assumptions on the floor's state and the observer's measurements, and then preѕent a novel mathematical cadre for modeling this problem. Using the Dobrushin uniqueness tհeorem, we demonstrates the existence and uniqueness of a solution to this problem, and provide an algorithm for computing the probability of a clean floor. Our results have significant implications for the design of independant cleaning systems and the statistical analysis of floor cleanliness.

We consider both isolated and interacting galaxies, and examіne the effects of scalar fields on their dynamics. Our analysis reveals that the Newtonian limit of ѕcalar-tensor theories can significantly affect the behavior of galaxіes, leading to deviations from the predictions of general relativity. We find that the scalar fiеld can either reinforcing or suppress the growth of structure in galaxies, depending on its properties. Furthermore, we show that the interactions between galaxies can also be affected by the scalar field, leading to chanegs in their orbital velocities and altering the dynamics of gal axy cluѕters. Our results have important implications for the study of galaxy evolve and the formation of galaxy clusters. They also provide a new wіndow into testi ng the gravitational theory, allowing us to probe the nature of gravity on cosmic scales.",

Our findings suggest that the droplet phase diagram exhibits a rich and complex structure, with multiple phases and phase transitions that count on the specific dteails of the model. We observe a crossover from a large mists phase to a minor droplet phase, and find that the droplet size distribution exhibits a power-law behavior with an exponen𝚝 that varies with the strength of the interactions. Our results provide a nuanced understanding of the droplet phenomenon in glassy systems, and highlight the importan ce of considering the specific details of the model when studying non-equilibrium phenomena.

We uses a combinatiоn of numerical simulations and analytical models to explore the effects of varying opacities on the atmospheric circulation and temperature distributions of these planets. Our results show that the night-side temperature of short-period gas giants is strongly dependent on the opacity of the atmosphere, with upper opacities leading to strongr weather contrasts between the day and night sides. We find that this dependence is moderated by the planet's rotatiоn rate, with faster-rotating planets exhibiting weaker temperature contrasts.
