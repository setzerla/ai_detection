All that was left was a crater filled with the liquefied remains of skyscrapers. We were left to wonder who did it, because we did n' t yet know of our Watchers. About 18 months later, every show on every channel was interrupted. An almost reptilian face came into focus. Its scales were green, and it had intricate orange designs painted onto its face. It cleared its throat, and I remember I was shocked because I knew it was about to speak. Without an introduction or any decorum, it began, \" Thou humans shall surrender on the 4th of July, or thou shalt face utter extinction. Thou shalt meet our generals at the ruins of your great city of New York, and there surrender yourselves into servitude. \" No one ever knew why the reptile spoke that way. I hypothesized later that they had been watching us for hundreds of years and somehow learned archaic English, but I had no way to be sure. The 4th of July came and went, and there was no sign of the great retribution we were promised. January 1, 2048: the land invasion began. The East and West coasts were both overwhelmed over the course of six months until humanity began to fight in earnest. We had begun the war with the weapons humanity had for hundreds of years: firearms that shot metal rounds, bombs, missiles, all weapons that depended on piercing a hard exterior to get to the flesh inside. One year after the invasion began, the US Army issued plasma rifles to every able-bodied human in the Heartland. They were almost the exact weapon the reptilian aliens used, but more ergonomic for human use. These weapons allowed humanity to create a fragile stalemate with the Watchers. *To Be Continued... * ( when I have time )",

I never get tired of looking at her, her skin smooth as plastic. Her eyes reflected the chandelier and gave off a twinkle, this is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. As I dig into the wonderful soup she made for me, I think back onto how we first met. I saw her online and knew immediately, there could not be a life without her. Without a second thought my mouse hit the purchase option and the window flashed, two weeks expected delivery. It had to be the hardest two weeks any man had to endure in their life. When the time came I was watching out my window, like a child waiting on Santa. The UPS truck pulled up and the carrier produced a medium sized box from his truck. I could n' t wait any longer and ran to meet him half way. This was it my queen, my life, my everything. As I ran inside I opened the box and there she was smiling back at me. At that moment I knew everything had changed for the better.",

A set of goggles hid his eyes from the harsh polar glare while the heavy thermal suit kept the worst of the howling winds at bay. Lieutenant Katya Ryzhkina stood besides him, equally wrapped beneath thick layers of wool and thermals. A wisp of blonde hair had escaped her suit' s hood and billowed about, tendrils of ice forming on the strands. \" Sorry to leave this ice cube? \" Deshler asked over his suit' s comm-unit. * \" No, not really, \" * answered Ryzhkina. * \" My ancestors came from Siberia, or so I' m told. They were Cossacks. \" * Deshler nodded, aware that the gesture was lost in the suit' s fur lined hood. This world was a far cry from his childhood home of Ryerson with its expansive forests and numerous rivers. Its polar regions were paltry, temperate things compared to Conarky' s, and although the taiga to the south made a welcome change of pace it was a poor substitute for Ryerson' s mixed forests. Without speaking, they both turned and started back towards the waiting dropship, its cargo already loaded and ready to go. The life of a mercenary was one of impermanence, cast adrift by fate and chance to follow the drum. They' d seen scores of worlds, each more different than the last.

My watch ticked just past four when I got there. A beautiful place, to be sure - isolated, expensive - cold, too. The cold was the problem, and I was the solution. I trudged up the steps, leaving footprints in light powder, and knocked. And knocked. And knocked. I began to get uneasy then. A night without heat could get bad in the mountains, and even though I had made it there as fast as I could, I got uneasy. I had spoken to the client just before eleven the night before - it had taken me a good five hours to reach the mountain home, even while pushing the speed limit as much as I could. Long story short, no one was home. I found the problem quickly - a few wires got crossed the wrong way the furnace, and I was on my way. I did n' t really notice anything was wrong until I got back to the city. I got progressively more worried the closer to home I got - my girlfriend had n' t text me so much as a \" good morning \". And there was no one on the road. No one. Not unusual coming out of the mountains, but in the city... lights were on, traffic signals directed nothing, and I could n' t see any signs of inexplicable disasters. It' s been silent since then.

The Earthlings had always had weapons because, even from the earliest days, in their pre-history, they had needed to defend themselves against savage neighbours.

He could have had gainful employment in a number of jobs. I heard the talk from the guards that this man read a book a day. I wonder what his life would have been like if he had applied himself. Instead, one unusually cold day in October, he went up to Katie' s car, pulled a gun, and demanded that she get out. Katie had always been a fierce girl, not one to let anybody tell her what to do. I' d taught her that her life is more valuable than any of her possessions, but her attitude got the better of her. And then she was dead. It was n' t the crime he was sentenced to death for, but a life of crime always had casualties. One of his just happened to mean something to me. The day of his execution, I waited with baited breath for the request. I' d cooked lobster, pizzas, and apple pies. I' d made the last hour of many men' s lives slightly better. I could n' t imagine what this man would want. I always prepared the kitchen beforehand for anything I might need to make. Two hours before his execution by lethal injection, I received a piece of paper. I leaned over the counter and opened it up. Grilled Cheese and Fries. I got to work. -- - Twenty minutes later I brought the tray to the killer' s cell. I peered in at the large man, sitting on his bunk with his head in his hands. After I tapped on the glass I got a glimpse of his face. He was crying. I opened the slot and slid the tray in. Once he had a hold of it, I let go and turned away. \" I' m sorry. \" I froze, unsure of what to say. The man had killed Katie. He had made life harder for Katie' s mother and myself, and he had done it over a shitty' 93 Jeep Cherokee. I turned. He stared into my eyes and said it again. \" I' m sorry. I really am. \" I turned and resumed walking away. Just before he was out of earshot, I glanced at him. \" So am I. \"",

The great experiment reached its conclusion, not with a fizzle, but with a bang. However, that does not mean the story of mankind need to end.

A dozen or so familiar faces — Zorxx the Great, High Priest of the Poinsai Beta star system; Derns the Fierce, Intergalactic Warlord of Epsilon 9; and Sol, Elder of a system so distant, it remains nameless — among others. The ceremony was to begin shortly. As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6, the Lottery was to be pulled on this date. Nature has a funny way. It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution. At the last ceremony, Earth was chosen by the prophet. And at the ceremony before that. Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries. It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council. The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old. Every 2000 suns, the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet. The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life. The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant. \" Civilizations crumble, People cry, Many will suffer, Many will die, Life is a blessing, But also a curse, Given this knowledge, Who knows which is worse? \" The Prophet began its process. It said nothing. Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber. Faces grew grim. At the rise of the New Sun, the fleets would be dispatched, and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born. One planet was chosen to grow. It was n' t Earth.",

Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people' s noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n' t let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. Some wizards are just too cocky. As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I' d begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n' t have one, at the time. But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n' t believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend.

He had a twinkle in his eye that just said *everything is ok* I said \" who are you? \" and the man replied \" I have many names. but the one you would be most familiar with is santa \" his warm voice vibrated in my ears as if he were speaking through a silky and soothing jazz tune. his eyes twinkled as he spoke to me. I questioned him further \" well, how did you get here? \" without even a slight pause he asked \" do you trust me, son? \" well I suppose I do n' t have a reason not to, you are santa after all. \" he pulled me close, gave me a big hug and whispered softly in my ear \" thats good, son. because the only way i can steal your soul is if you trust me. \"",

For the past year I have been delivering for Smitty' s Pizza Hut to get the extra cash I need for my tuition bill. I' ve already submitted my two week notice and this is my last day, in fact my last delivery before moving back home to California. The sound of the door bell has a very odd sound. It chimed three times with one press of the bell. I began to reach for the doorbell again before I heard the foot steps. It sounds like a heavy set person. Maybe this customer does n' t need this delivery. The door opened slowly with a very audible creak before revealing a man wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and a very cartoonish Ronald Reagan mask. \" Nice mask bro. Here' s your pizza. That' ll be $ 18. 72. \" The man just stood there staring at me. He had a very foul smell about him and I could very easily hear heavy breathing. Thank goodness he' s wearing that mask. I bet this guys breath smells about as bad as the stench emitting from what is more than likely an unbathed body. \" It' s $ 18. 72. You want this pizza or not? \" I shifted my weight and my gaze was caught at the scene that was beyond him. A woman and two children were tied to chairs with make shift gags of cloth in their mouths. The cloth in the woman' s mouth was drenched and had spittle being flung around as she violently shook her head trying to do what I can very easily assume was scream for help. That was when I noticed the gun. It was firmly gripped in the hand of the man standing before me pointed downwards. It was then that the man finally spoke his first words. \" You' re just in time for the party. \" As he rose the gun to my face I felt my entire body begin to freeze. The boxes fell from my hands and landed hard on the ground. \" Pick that up and come inside. Everyone is going to need to be fed if were going to have a fun night. \"",

Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing after all. Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment where… One moment where the sound was deafening. There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn' t change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke. \"The World Trade Centers have been hit. \"I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet. As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.",

With his finances taken care of, and relationships closed on a good note, he knew he was finally free to make any decision that he chose. It was a freeing feeling, one he knew would be fleeing as soon as tomorrow.

Keep in mind this was the second of the peace talks. \" We are prepared to make peace with your people. Significant time has passed, and there is no reason for further hostilities. We admit that we are held back somewhat by our culture. For seven generations we have built up a deep hatred of humankind, but we hope we can stop that with enough time. \" I interjected. \" But wait, you said in our first peace talks four weeks ago that you were previously unaware of our existence! \" Our translator expressed my words, and was soon met with a response from the aliens representative. \" Yes, exactly. Four weeks.

The feed was on every screen; after it was cut the videos were replayed, over and over. The sterile, cold atmosphere of the station' s workspace. The gleaming chrome of the equipment. That was the first thing you noticed about the interior of the ISS. The inky black of space, visible through the vertical viewport. It was all in monochrome; a world of grays and muted whites. And then, drifting slowly into view, globules of incongruous red. It was funny, was n' t it, how nobody noticed the astronauts at first. You were just expecting them to be there at their posts, the brave men of our nation taking humanity to new heights as we transcended the skies. Calmly managing their duties with a watchful air, stolidly reliable in their assuredness as they moved about their tasks. They would n' t just simply stop, would they? All through this, silence. And the camera shakes. The interior of the space station shudders, sending flickers of distortion through the video feed. Bumps and jolts send the camera floating away from its initial position, slowing as it collided into the viewport. A glimpse of the Earth itself. A blue-green marble in the middle of the void. The stars shone pin-point bright as the feed continued. Something pushed off the side of the station. Mottled patches of silver and shadow. A sense of serpentine motion. Direction. Purpose. Intent. Descending towards us, even as we stared into our screens, from the heavens down to Earth.",

Sometimes, I' m feeling too much and do n' t know how to handle it, so I just have to get it out and down on the paper. Sometimes It' s because I have something to say. Sometimes it' s because I have nothing to say. Sometimes I' m not sure I care what I' m saying at all, I just like the feeling of words flowing through my fingertips. I would n' t recommend writing out of obligation. It never seems to turn up good results.

Two windows, on the other side of which was a beautiful world. Full of colors, full of life, full of people. They found themselves - it found itself? - at a loss for how to describe it. The words from their - its? - lips floundered, fell, stuttered, and eventually fell silent, feeling inadequate. Piles of letters and phrases littered the floor, and it huddled deeper within its confines, burdened by an overwrought sense of divine presence overbearing its creative design. Behind, on the other side of the seat, a creature with a knife sat, slashing up words that it snatched from the floor. With eyes keen and set on destroying every misplaced syllable, it forgot its true purpose, and the shards and vowels and consonants lay fragile across the floor. A cackle left its lips as it slowly pulled' floccinoxihiliphilipication' apart, delicious symbol by symbol, before letting each one hit the floor in turn. The chuckling turned to a mad howling as the blanket suddenly found its way around the little monster, muffling it as the other being rose to its full height and strode to the windows, hands on the windows as it watched the ongoing events outside. Eyes wide, full of wonder, full lines of paper seemed to fall from its mouth in a never-ending stream of fantasy and delight. The little beast screeched and hooted, desiring so much to silence the other in its room, but could only escape once the words stopped.",

First was one of his first sold swords, Hellpoker. Made in a backyard kiln, he was amazed that people kept on bringing it back. Meant for youngsters to prod at the local wildlife and dangerous fauna, but somehow always made it' s way into the nether regions of the mine. From time to time, an Inquisitor or Paladin would return it without charge from the body of a young man. Still, keeps the roof over his head. Goblets and gauntlets, the greater things in life grander than gold. He found the Pendant of Strength, a misnomer for many. It' s aura of protection and increased ability to sustain heavy weights meant it was grand for hoarders of small things, merchants and farmers. Where it normally landed was the dungeon as thieves tried to raid farmers, merchants and hoarders. The city guard were always gracious to lend it back for a pretty price. Silverware from trolls and bugles from goblins. Funny things those, you never take green skins to have great taste in cutlery or music. Funny story about one of the gems that keeps on returning. A large sapphire, a queer misshapen thing above the side of two fists. Adventurer' s named it Heart of the Harp, saying even queerer things like destroying her form will drop you this piece of old stone. Still, it' s a great piece to have above your mantle piece or in your wares, especially if their relatives come to reclaim it to resurrect their dead. Weird and wired things come in from dwarf rifles to mages wands. I' ve seen a traveller come clean off a dungeon with more than a libraries' worth of scrolls. Some of it new, some of it old, it always makes a smile appear on Grover of Innsroot.",

I may just be a newly graduated psychologist, but I' m fully trained, and after helping the new and improved Mr. J. Kerr through the rigors of a job search and new apartment finding, I' m honestly a little surprised he was interred here at all. He' s fully aware of his surroundings and his actions, and the consequences - which clears him of many of the major empathy disorders. He' s also un-powered, unlike some of the other patients that were slated for rehabilitation. As far as I can tell, he' s just a lonely old man, trying desperately to reclaim action in his life. He' s been nothing but sweet to me, too. I' m sure the heavily armed guards helped, but he' s never once given me reason to fear him. I suppose the only incident that stands out to me was the way he acted when someone mentioned Batman near him. He maintained that nigh-omnipresent smile, but it felt like the warmth was gone. I' m not sure what changed in him, but it suddenly made me very nervous. Maybe the rivalry truly is as bad as the reports say it was. Either that, or maybe the caped crusader should be the one doing community service. Honestly, who does he think he is, beating up poor Mr. J like that? Batman can take down anyone, even people with strange powers beyond compare, and she spends his time harassing this single man? And what, because his skin was bleached? According to the records that was actually Batman' s fault, too! I really do appreciate the company, though. Sometimes it feels like it' s me and him versus the world.",

I had to make some quick thinking in order to peacefully negotiate our captors into relinquishing their hold on our aircraft. I quickly called out for a piece of paper and a sharpie. Thankfully the teen girl sitting across the aisle from me had both! Even though the sharpie she gave me was a hot pink, mini sharpie, it was enough. I quickly sketched out a picture of what I needed and BAM! It came to reality! I stood up and held in my arms what I had drawn. A full case of Jameson! I passed a bottle to each member of the IRA and, after finishing a few bottles over the course of some hours, they gave up the controls of the airplane to me. They then grabbed their parachutes and jumped out of the plane! Now when they jumped out, they left the plane with no fuel somewhere over the ocean, and I have no experience in flying a plane, and I may be writing this on a piece of scrap metal in a raft as the other passengers look at me with angry eyes, but I saved the plane from being hijacked! I think I did good. Everyone is now staring at me while they are holding plastic forks. I think that means it' s time for dinner. Got ta go! Until tomorrow, diary.",

After so many years have been lived, your own soul starts to crumble under its own weight and your sanity becomes lost. As the Ethereals are the closest thing to gods, they watch over our every action, recording and analyzing. Over the eons I have learned that the Ethereals can not reproduce, and seem to fabricate our souls and run them through a battery of simulations to determine if we are worthy of ascendence. Fortunately, I have been a very successful Buddhist monk for several of my recent cycles, and a philosopher in three others. The Ethereals seem to be taking a liking to me as each cycle I have been able to select more extravagant life features. However, I think they are more interested that I declined to opt for the upgrades and stuck with the minimum to get my goals done. After all, it' s harder to become a monk when living in Las Vegas. A strange light caught my attention nearby. And choatic orange, black and red light burst from a soul chamber near me. The poor soul as destabilized.

A great transformation took hold inside me. My form converted into that of the Ethereals, and a rush of knowledge of all things that were and are became known to me. I then knew at that time I had achieved true enlightenment.",

The past six months have been so hectic, so filled with dread. The only hope we had was me. I was uninfected, despite my obvious exposure. At first the Foundation had me contained, held simply to observe the advancement of the Clockwork Virus. A week passed, then two, none of the typical symptoms had manifested in me. They grew curious. By the first month, they had postulated that I was immune, the only human- scratch that, the only living animal on Earth that was known to be immune. Tests were carried out, biopsies, blood drawings, injections of God-knows-what. I hated it at first, but the Foundation treated me well. They made it very clear that what I was doing would save the world. I talked myself into believing them. Months passed, they were getting no results. They began to panic. Almost a fifth of the world' s population was infected. They grew desperate. I was desperate to help them, to save humanity. Their experiments began to grow more invasive. \" It was necessary, \" they said. I had to believe them. Yesterday was a breakthrough, but not the kind they were hoping for. Every iteration of the virus they had come across so far devolved people into mindless, numb machines. Dr. Clef was the first to realize it, after I offhandedly remarked that his phone was dead. He had n' t had it out. I' m not immune, I' m just the next step of the infection.",

Then they were curious. Then they were among us. Then they owned us. We accepted our place as servants of the gods. We brought them offerings of the minerals that abounded under the surface of our planet. We wanted to please them. We told ourselves we wanted to serve our new gods, our benevolent new gods. Even though they demanded it, we believed we wanted it. They kept their miraculous technology to themselves, for the most part. We only saw glimpses and glimmers that kept the mystery alive. A shimmering orb produced from a robe to communicate with those back on the ship, a cruel weapon that produced beams of deadly light when one of us displeased them. And of course, the airships that hung, hung always over our heads. I wish I could say we learned our error, fought back and overthrew our overlords who did nothing but take from us, but we did not. One day, years after the offerings had come in dribbles and the mineral deposits were all but gone, so were they. The ships disappeared without a trace, and we never saw them again. Now our planet is a husk, raped and pillaged and left with nothing. We limp on, us former slaves, and grow our own technology, and work for the day when we will become gods in the sky.",

I realize that this may leave me very little time to reveal my last words but I hope I can relay my life and what it has meant to me as best I can. I have led a very happy life where I have accomplished so much, I made it to the ripe age of 29 and my career was about to take off. As I sit here realizing that death is near, I find myself thinking of the only woman that I ever loved. Her name was Jennifer and she broke my heart after years of happiness. She was everything a man could ever dream of having and I will never forget the day that she made a move on me. She was standing there, looking as beautiful as ever when I confessed that I had feelings for her. I remember the look in her eyes when she realized what I was trying to say to her and how quickly she jumped on me to kiss me as passionately as I would ever be kissed in my life. She ruined first kisses for me because I knew that no other first kiss would ever be that good again. I have thought about that kiss every night since it happened. Jennifer left me for another man and even though it has been 3 years, I still have a broken heart that longs for her. I know we could have had a life together, in fact, I would have married her and I would have had children with her. Fuck her. Now that I think about it, I moved away because I could n' t bear the thought of running into her and her new douchebag of a man. If it had n' t been for her, I would n' t even be in this situation right now. I hope that this virus spreads and she gets eaten alive. I hope they tear her limb from limb. Fuck everything, this world was a shithole in general and it was shitty to me. I never got anything done and I' m fucking glad that I' m going to die. Fuck this world. -Matt*hew* *Be* lt e r",

I went to school, I became a lawyer, and I never had a family. Everyone else thought that was sad, but I enjoyed life anyway. Then one day, a mischievous girl came to my window and beckoned me away. She was beautiful, interesting, lovely. I was dreaming. I had to be. But no; this little, miniature woman flew high above me and taught me how to move through the air like she could. She pulled me along while we flew through London, soaring over the city. We would do this nightly, and every morning, exhausted, I would take myself to work. It was worth it, though, and I never said no. And one night, she gripped my finger, her tiny hands barely wrapping around it. She tugged to indicate I should follow her, and... I did. I never looked back. Neverland is truly a place where childhood dreams come true. I found a crew, and we sailed, fighting bad guys and finding treasure, with my little fairy on my shoulder. She always had a temper, though. It was part of her feisty personality, and I loved it... until she decided she was bored of our life. And then she flew off, and I never saw her again. Until a few years later. A few troublemakers had begun running about Neverland, harassing people and stealing treasure I' d buried. My crew and I decided to teach him a lesson- nothing bad, just tell him to knock it off. He was just a kid, after all. And as we approached him, I suddenly saw her, sitting on his shoulder. My Tink. She had left and found another Lost person without a family and brought him here, to our place, to my dream land. I guess I lost a part of myself that day, and Neverland was never the same.

The crowd was going restless, and there was a palpable tension all throughout the room.

The two saw each other coming from opposite ends of the empty street. He smiled. She smiled. The two embraced, holding each other for a long time. David opened the door for her, and the two entered the barren cafe together, sitting down at their usual table. Before David could get a word in, Claire put a small piece of paper on the table. David picked it up, his eyes scanning from top to bottom. His face lit up, and Claire could see tears swelling in his eyes. \" Twins? \" he asked. Claire smiled, her eyes growing wet as well. She felt her body grow warm, and noticed the flow of sunlight grow brighter and brighter. David looked through the window of the empty, forgotten cafe. He let out a long, defeated sigh. A sigh that echoed the sound of a future that would never be. He reached in to his pocket, opening the small box. Claire' s eyes twinkled in the sunlight, and she removed the delicate ring from his hands, placing it over her own ring finger. \" It' s beautiful, \" she said in awe. The heat grew, and she could feel it burning at her skin. She looked into David' s eyes one last time, and he took her by the hands. Tears streamed down his face, and he gently kissed Claire' s hand.

There are rumors and tales told by cultists groups about how the forefathers of UPF ( United Planet of Freedom ) warned them of the Red territory. Something about Communist bastards can always be heard around those circles. Jerry ran and got Lewis, his supervisor. Lewis also had a hard time believing what he saw.

It was forbidden by the galactic Congress to enter communications with any systems not fully pledged to democracy. If the rumors about the red territory are true then there is a certainty that relaying that message would be a all expenses paid trip to Maximum Security Prison. Jerry looked at the recipient who was supposed to receive this message and it read Vladimir Milkev. Jerry and Lewis looked at each other and knew what they were about to do.

Their were still plenty of normal humans spread throughout the stars, but those of us who remained on Holy Terra had chosen a different path. After fighting long and hard to try and adapt the world we lived in to our needs, we had finally decided to simply adapt our needs to the world we lived in. We incorporated all the best traits of life found on Earth, and coded them into our genome. Our green skin now hinted at our ability to photosynethisize energy, ending hunger and removing the need for farming or hunting. We mostly lived in the forest, which had finally reclaimed much of what had formally called \"civilization \". We also incorporated traits from our cetecean bretheren, allowing those who wished to return to the oceans where life on our world began, and learn the sagas sung by the elder whales. Our senses had been modified to detect colors and sounds our ancestors could only dream about, spurring an amazing renesseciance in the arts. We no longer needed the massive strength of our ancestors, and opted for smaller, lighter, more efficient bodies. With our bat-like ears, colored skin, and dimunitive nature, offworlders sometimes referred to us by the moniker \"elves \". We did not mind their jesting, for we were finally at peace; not only with our world, but with ourselves as well.",

As usual, Xyrybl landed on the front lawn of the most powerful force on the planet and, as usual, he extended some tentacles in greetings, some whirring through the air, fending off random weaponry thrown at him.

As I looked up at the board, four burly men clad in dark attire burst in through the door, wearing balaclavas and wielding various guns. Time seemed to freeze. Some of my classmates screamed. Some cried. Some did n' t react at all. My teacher shouted at the men but got out no more than two unintelligible words before one of them took aim with their pistol and doubletapped him in the head. The class started panicking. Some ran. Some froze. I stared in shock at the sight of my teacher' s brains spilling out all over the floor. He was dead. As my adrenaline kicked in, I sprang up and frantically made a beeline for the door. More gunshots erupted as several of my classmates piled to the floor. I screamed and charged straight at one of the attackers. He raised his assault rifle and brought the stock of the gun crashing down onto the back of my head. I crumpled to the ground, defeated. More gunshots erupted as I saw another one of my classmates drop to the floor. Bodies lay around me as I gradually faded out of consciousness. The next time I woke up was inside a speeding van. My hands were cuffed behind my back and a rag was over my eyes. I could n' t see anything. Then, as my movement was no doubt detected, the rag was ripped off my face. A man was watching me closely. He was close to me. Too close. I could smell his breath as he spoke a few menacing words to me, that chilled me to the bone. \" You have started a war. \" He smiled widely, revealing a shabby set of teeth. Why me?",

I wish I could take it back, I regret doing those terrible things that I did to her. \" I wonder who the interpreter is interpreting for, \" I think to myself, I look around, and then I spot her sitting in the very back, IT' S AMANDA!

In 2014, I was responsible for the invasion of the Rathikin Crusade. In 2013, with the successful invention of my time machine, I removed the country of France from history itself. Wait, you would n' t remember that one. Just take my word for it. It was a country, now it' s not, that' s a pretty impressive piece of work, if I do say so myself. Why am I here? Time and time again, I' ve been defeated by those absolute imbeciles, the Super Squad. I tire of losing to these narrow minded posers- yes, posers. All the power at their fingertips, but no vision! No ambition! The things we could accomplish if they would only join me! But I digress. I' m on a quest for self betterment- and no, not through genetic manipulation or cybernetic enhancement again. I' ve realized I do not live up to my full potential. For in truth- as Captain Clock reminds us all in every. single. press conference, I do not infact hold the degree my title implies. Even if such a paltry academic achievement is unlikely to improve my new plan for world domination, It will be a joy to see that overgrown pocket watch struggle to find a new soundbite. However, growing a cloned Super Squad is a very demanding task. Nutrient feeds, power level monitoring, and subconscious loyalty training make attending classes a bit of a hassle.

About half were left to face the invading Russian army that was expected to arrive tomorrow. The good news for Sammy was his test was cancelled, his crush and bully were gone, and he had an overwhelming sense of optimism and certainty that he could accomplish anything. Later the remaining townsfolk gathered together to discuss their strategy. It' s here that Sammy' s willpower proved especially decisive and he was able to convince the town to unconditionally surrender and also provide the best housing for the Russian troops. The few Mafia members left in town were swayed by his words and gave him two extra days to pay back his $ 3000 loan and only bumped it up to $ 4500. The following morning Sammy would march out with a white flag and meet the oncoming troops. He convinced their commander to accept the town' s surrender and he also informed on the Mafia members who were rounded and imprisoned. Sammy' s strategy was so successful the Russians tapped him to continue his campaign of surrender to the poor who could n' t flee. Sammy did so and after Russia had taken most of the country bloodlessly appointed him Governor. Sammy' s bully and crush lived their lives smashed into the quarter of the country the Russians had forced those that had fled into and were fairly miserable especially when the crush would bring up Sammy' s success. Sammy also got a sexy math tutor and became excellent at math. Due to the bloodless and relatively peaceful invasion the people who stayed would go on to lead better lives and be slightly happier than they were before.",

The only human contact was, at the most, a gloved hand that dropped the food through the slot in the aging iron door. Never once was I spoken to. The first fifty years were the hardest. My mental health, decayed from a millennia of archaic drugs, had finally trapped me within the system of justice that I saw birthed from the fledgling nation I at many times fought for. Amazing how clear ones mind can become after a century of total isolation. I' ve never feared death. I' ve feared many things but never death. At one point I believed me eternal life was a gift. An eternity of watching the world shift and grow, for better or for worse. Eternity. An eternity of watching friends, family, and lovers die. I tried at many points in my unending life to put an end to it. Poisons made me ill. Blades cut, but drew no blood. I was an immortal amongst men. I ran from my failures and tried to blind myself from my reality. Man created drugs for that reason. And I tumbled for centuries blind to my own actions and blind to the world. I never wanted to ham anyone. The ones I hurt. Accidents. Self defense. With my captivity, I found myself again. It' s been two lifetimes since then it' s nearly time for me to taste freedom once again. Perhaps it' s time I did some good in this never ending life.",

Does that make it beautiful? \"\"Well a lot of peo- \"\"DON' T FUCKING INTERRUPT ME WHEN I' M ANSWERING YOUR FUCKING QUESTIONS! \"\"O- \"SHUT THE FUCK UP! \"\"... \"\"So, let me pick up where I left off: Does that make life beautiful? It' s fragility and need for protection? I think it does. But what' s more beautiful than life? Anything? Love maybe? But I had never seen love. You don' t see a lot of love growing up in a foster home without heat or running water. Where, in the winter, you had to walk outside barefoot to gather snow so you could melt it on the stove for water. Where you' d be up all night giving your foster brother rancid water while he threw up the corner of your room, dehydrated, sick, no way to get to the hospital without a car especially when the streets are covered in five feet of snow. So I set out to find love. See it with my own eyes. Feel its beauty. Bask in it. And let me tell you, it is delicious. \"When I found my first pair they were stopped at a motel in San Diego, en route to Mexico for their first and only honeymoon. Oh they were sappy. It was sick. Oozing this superficial jubilance. Bragging about their matrimony with their smiling and content. But it wasn' t until I had her tied up on their bed with her intestines in my hands that I saw true love. The grit and fight that real love is. Both of his wrists dislocated and bloddy in the rope I used to tie him to the radiator. That' s true love and that' s all there is and ever will be to this sick world. \"edit: I' m new to this whole formatting jazz, excuse me.",

They remind us with their cold clarity that all the rest are gone. The photos are hoaxes, the moon landing never happened, there are no faces or pyramids on mars, no odd phenomena on the other planets, the asteroid belt was not once a planet, no other gas giant was ever thrown off orbit by its neighbours, no reason why the giant pictograms are carved into the vast plains of this world, no reason why all the pyramid like structures on every continent resemble each other, no reason but one. Us. We the lonely remnants. In our dreams and imagination we remember them. Every story holds a kernel of the truth. So long ago, we forgot, in the struggle to survive. We failed to remember and in our failure we forgot why we needed to survive and so we tread the same paths to destruction. Soon we won' t just be alone. We too, will be gone.",

I do n' t think anyone should be discouraged based on what a website tells them though. If you feel that your lexicon needs some sprucing up, read the works of others or just cross-reference some of your own words with a thesaurus/dictionary. You might find that there are words that express what you want to say even better. As far as feeling inferior to others, that is a natural feeling in the world of literature. No one is a master of all art-forms ( and few are a master of even one. ) Yet, there are people who exist in the world as literary giants. So feeling inferior is okay as long as you do n' t fall into despair about it. If you are inferior, expand your vocabulary and improve your skills. You could even look at those websites as challenges to overcome or test your limits. So keep at it, Wr_2213.",

I pretended to be asleep and noticed how he suspiciously watched me as he took a small water bottle out of his back pack filled with a glowing neon pink fluid. He put the bottle in the fridge and started shuffling through the drawers like he was desperately looking for something. He kept looking at me every few seconds so I kept my eyes closed to avoid detection and within a few minutes I hard the door slam. I quickly rose from my bed, throwing the covers off my body and moved towards the fridge in the dark room. Just before I reached the fridge he stepped out of the dark corner towards me.

A quick repsponse. \" Why were you heading towards the fridge. A long pause. \" What was that bottle? \" \" Why do you look so stressed out? \" He moved closer to me. Now we were face to face. Noses almost touching. He cocked his head to the side and tried to kiss me. \" What the fuck bro? \" I pushed him away. He back stepped and stumbled into the darkness again.

The first fuck up was due to the ancient middle east conflicts. A lot of the crazies over there saw this as a test of their faith and had decided to prove that they deserving of forty virgins or whatever by being extra rowdy. We solved this problem by finding a bunch of virgins willing to take one for the team and giving them in groups of forty to each terrorist. At first we did n' t think we had enough volunteer virgins, but upon realizing that goat virgins were acceptable everything turned out fine. The second fuck up came from congress, they were ironically locked in conflict over the best way to handle the situation. It was an easy problem to solve however, we just told each one of them separately that if they kept voicing their opinion we would reveal tapes we had of their homosexual airport encounter. Everything was going great, we had went ninety days without conflict when it happened...

Like he' d given up on life. I watched him get up, take his keys, and then finally disappear like the others. I' d been watching the bar scene for two minutes. I waited for five-week me to show up. There was supposed to be more, was n' t there? Why has n' t the five-week version of me shown up yet? Then the realization struck: Maybe five-week me had n' t shown up because there was no five-week me. I felt nauseous. Like someone had fed me a dozen eggs and then punched me in the gut. In less than five weeks' time, I will be dead. As I faded back to reality, I only had one thought: I need a drink.",

Ryoku is a power that every human is born with. Those who are born with enough of the power may have the chance to access it at some point in their lives. These people are called Sources, and account for about 1 in every 10 people. Strength can vary between Sources. Some are only strong enough to light a cigarette, or create a static shock. Some can flood cities, or cause earthquakes. Sources are heavily regulated, brought into an Organization the moment they gain access to their Ryoku. At that point, the Organization' s board members decide which to train and which to let go. Those who are let go are Silenced, cut off from their Ryoku. There are few negative effects when this is done early. I awoke as a Source when I was five, one of the youngest in the history of the Organization. My potential scared the Organization, and I was almost Silenced. The kindness of the man who would become my teacher is the only thing that saved me. I look back on their fear now and laugh. My potential was a joke, I am unable to access even half of what they feared. I' m nothing but a mediocre pawn to them anymore, and they could n' t care less if I were alive or dead. Rage burns deep inside me, for my situation, for the Organization, for the fact that I am unable to be the man I always dreamed of being. There are times when I explode, and there is nothing that can contain me. We do not get to choose our elements, but they always end up being a perfect match. I wonder, did fire choose me because I would inevitably be the person I am now, or did I become the person I am now because of the fire raging inside me?",

I counted my blessing for this unique opportunity to learn from, and teach, such a rare and primitive tribe. I began with cooking. I showed them different methods and options that could be used. The tribe took to these with little to no interest. The main problem was the lack of food supplies, living mostly on a diet of fruit and squashed bugs. So I showed them how to hunt. They had never tried anything like it before. They didn' t even have a hand gesture to signify it. But they loved it. I watched them spend all day casting spears and nets into the river, banging their chests and hooting loudly. I had never seen them happier. One of them ( I had nicknamed Steve ) even managed to spear a fish on his first day. I felt privileged to have made such a dramatic change in the day to day living of these simple people. The next day I found one of the tribesmen dead, with a spear lodged in his neck. Steve stood over him. I pointed at the body ( the native method of questioning something ). Steve pointed to his stomach ( meaning hungry ) and then made a spear throwing gesture ( which now meant, hunt ). That night, the tribe sang, danced and ate red meat. I left the next day.",

I thought a while that I should then retreat, Though both my shoes were held fast by the mud. I watched the figure digging in the dirt, Unconsciously, my legs began to shake. I thought that if my eyes I did avert, The fear would leave and I might cease to quake. Then suddenly, after what seemed an age, I saw him rest the shovel by his side. And though while he had dug, his face was sage, The figure then knelt on the ground and cried. He gently placed the bag into the grave, And laid his hand upon it as he spoke. Though try he did to his composure save, His eyes were moist, and on tears did he choke. And soft he spoke the words through tearful breath, As he filled in the dirt and laid a stone. \" I love you boy, in life and now in death, You were the best dog I did ever own. \"",

I crushed the letter into a pulp and let it fall to the floor where it was swallowed up by the limbo void. What now? I mean there was always purgatory but the place was quieter than limbo and the admin had n' t dropped in to decorate the place for a long long time. Hmm. How long exactly? I knew that Heaven had abolished its squatters rights aeons ago, but maybe purgatory had never bothered because no one wanted to live there. I flicked through the legal charters and found the deed I was looking for. Aha! I knew it! Purgatory is literally up for grabs if I succeed in turning it into a home before the admin gets back. I started off spawning a few items here and there; a bed, a table, some chairs - but as time immeasurably progressed it turned into a full fledged living quarter complete with a courtyard and moat. It was just me at the beginning, but when my parole officer came by to check on me, I let him know that I was open for anyone as long as they adhered by the following rule: 1. Do what you want, but do n' t be a complete insufferable asshat. People came in waves, mostly freshies at first who were only able to add more furniture like I did - but then we started getting visits from Hell and that' s when we started getting some decent TV, our own Wifi, and copious amounts of alcohol. We even started getting some visits from curious Heaven inhabitants, wanting to blow off steam and willing to trade cloud vapour with us for a few minutes of fun. People wonder how our population has n' t exploded and created the overpopulation problems plaguing Heaven and Hell, but the asshat rule generally keeps people in check - and keeps away a large proportion of those who could only live in the other two realms. Most people are insufferable asshats, who knew?",

He was a squire for his knight Sir Rodrick and would have rather been polishing his lieges armor or cleaning his sword rather than hunting down dinner but when the paige came looking for the knight and found him' indisposed' decisions had to be made. The paige explained the problem. As it turned out the castle mage had been playing around with enchantment spells, supposedly to try and make food alcoholic. Why he didnt simply stew the goose in whiskey was beyond Gregs imagination but the damage had been done. Running loose inside the castle was an abnormally large goose that smelled strongly of beer and hops. Sir Rodrick was the only knight in the castle at this time and the guards refused to fight the goose, it both terrified them and left them immobile from lack of breath. It seemed every-time they engaged it they would begin burst out in laughter as one of them was singled out to be chased. To make matters worse the goose had now entered the living area of the royals quarters and cornered the princess in her room. Evidently she had been enjoying a nice roast duck and the goose caught wind of it. The order had been given, the payment promised was the goose and a few gold coins. Greg did not need either of these things however, he had a strong dislike for the princess and would love nothing more then to see the terror in her eyes as a drunk goose kept her hostage in her room. There were no ballads to sing praises for Gregs bravery though no man had faced a foe of such odor and ferocity. The battle was quick and his joy sublime as he found that roasted, the goose fat was whiskey and its meat like beer.",

Some people hated it. \" Political correctness gone mad, \" they said. \" We' re falling down a slippery slope! \" Others... well, some others loved it from the start. But for most people it was just awkward and difficult. People who' ve lived their whole lives choosing how they presented themselves to the world, basing their identities on their image. We even taught fashion here, and these new rules certainly shook up that department. So, at first the adjustment was the hardest part. Eventually, though, people dealt with it. Some of the angry voices went silent, and the worst calmed down to a disgruntled murmur. The repeated explanations from admin - it' s proven to help with self-esteem, it creates a more accepting culture, it gets rid of obvious rich/poor boundaries - started to sink in. The students themselves spread the word to their family and friends, and defending the choices the university made. We were proud of our new image. And the best part? It actually worked! We were all more confident in ourselves, we cared less about appearance and more about what we were as people. Some of the predicted \" downsides \" did come true, but hey change is a good thing, and downsides turned into upsides. All in all, I really like our university now. The change was hard, but we made it through. The biggest hurdle now is getting the other unis to stop calling us \" University of Nude. \"",

As I walked, I could hear the hollow echo of the wooden platform below my feet. That' s when something caught my eye: a sticky note stuck to the bottom of my shoe. The note read, \" I' m sorry I left you, but they tried to use you as collateral on me. Run. Do n' t look for me.

Apparently, the killer was only there to take a life. An hour passed as the coroner and crime scene investigators came and went. The Lieutenant sat in the office chair recently occupied by the deceased. He passed the time, puffing on his cigar, mulling over the facts.

But I' ll write a story anyway, assuming there is a problem with that for some reason. Also, plants do n' t have a central nervous system so they do n' t have nerves or a brain to perceive pain. Vegans began to starve after it was discovered that plants feel pain. Some continued with their same old diets, but many chose to starve. Humans can live for weeks without food fortunately, but still require water, which was n' t an issue. Many vegans began trying to find ways to reduce their consumption and create the most nutrient efficient diets that would allow for the least amount of food to be eaten with the most nutrition derived. After a year, many had died, but in the process, an optimal diet had been created. Not only that, but variations of the diet had been created for all different kinds of climates where only certain foods were available. New agricultural techniques were created to optimize crop output without the use of genetically modified organisms. People in places of starvation had more food available to them. New methods of growing food in laboratories had been created, and this led to not only food being produced, but the expansion of ability to create organisms and parts of organisms like limbs and organs in laboratories. 3D food printers were created and capable of growing cells and printing them out into new kinds of food. Like a forest that burns down, the ashes laid the foundation for the new to take the place of the old.",

George had slipped and died in the most unexpected manner, and I had instinctively answered to his name when called. It just seemed the most natural thing to do. I found the transition easy, effortless. It was just so simple. So now I' m walking down a nature path, which happens to be in my neighbourhood ( my late friend' s aunt had left me some several million ) when I was hit in the back of the head, something light. I turned around to see a blonde lady with long curls and blue eyes lift up her hand in a salute, then disappear behind a tree up the path. Looking down on the floor I saw a paper airplane. Opening it up was the message - *I have waited my entire life to meet you. You are the CHOSEN. The special, all elusive Mr Garfield Heinriskson. Your duty is great and large and fraught with trial. Meet me behind* the behind was drawn in a hurry. Behind what I wondered. I looked at the back of the paper, expecting something else perhaps. Nothing. I looked around at where I last saw her, and that' s when I felt a poke in the back. \" Hello there mister \" Jumping almost out of my skin, I spun around to face the blonde girl. \" I' m sorry, Lady, but I havent the faintest as to who this Garfield gentleman is. \" Her face dropped, and in a childlike manner she pursed her lips. \" But I was so sure... \" she gazed off in the distance. \" Hmm maybe I miscalculated the dates and the leap year equations... \" and with a touch of a watch on her arm, she poofed out of existence. I blinked. Garfield... Why did that name sound so... Very.. Familiar. \" WAIT! \"",

But then there was the error. Soon he realized he had created enemies that were stronger than they had been. They would have wiped him out had they not been busy battling each other. He was relegated to the shadows, watching, sending his minions to discover what this' Mall' was. Finally a mage was able to see through the bonds of space and time and see what a' Mall' was. Sauron was angry, but then realized what he needed to do. And thus began his construction. The Dead Marshes were filled in with something called' Blacktop' and had strange lines painted on it. Throughout this there were steel post radiating an unholy light down on any who passed below them. Next came the changes to Mordor. The whole of the vast seat of evil was now a huge labyrinth. The brightly lit corridors all seemed as if they would lead to the center, but none truly did. Then there were the minions. There battle armor still in place, but painted in bright colors. Many now new the battle cry' May I Help You!'. One of the most dreaded of the minions was a specialist that would suddenly appear and spray something than run away shouting' It is on sale!' Finally, the last piece was in place. The wall surrounding mordor had actually been partially covered during all of the construction, but now came the unveiling, the one weapon that would lead the men, elves, and dwarves to their doom. Sauron pulled a lever and as he did, great tarps and shade fell from the wall revealing huge painted sigils of power. \" Up to 90 % off! Everything must go! Hurry, sale ends soon! \"",

Trees that once framed his favorite haunt now were downed and mutiliated into thick, insurmountable sheets. His eyes glazed upward towards an opposing pair of eyes. The face atop the wall panicked and thrust one of the tree' s dismembered branches into Bill' s right eye. Bill found the exchange unpleasant and wandered off from the fortress. Some distance away he encountered a large pack of undead. This was a pleasant surprise for Bill as packs had been thinning ever since the ressurrections. Joining the pack, Bill and company sauntered through the woodlands in a close knit formation. Strange sounds echoed among the forest surroundings as moonlight crept in through the leaves. A mob of the living wielding burning tree limbs circled the pack and began to light every zombie on fire. Bill moaned and swatted in a pathetic attempt at protest. The living were going to destroy everything he loved. In a desperate attempt, Bill climbed upon the nearest living body and sunk his teeth into its head. Gnawing uncontrollably, Bill continued until he felt a squish. The living body stopped struggling and became noticably more docile. The other zombies, still ablaze, watched in fascination. A few copied his efforts and saw a similar outcome. The unchewn living shreiked and retreated. Bill and company decide they had a chance to take back their peaceful world. He dreamed of the day he and his kind could roam freely through unspoiled pastures.",

As the child developed, the repetitive noise gave way to words but the child still wandered and tripped through the darkness completely alone. Soon, the cries turned to whimpers; frightened, little moans that told of a darkness so heavy, it tore under its fingernails and dug at the drums in its ears. Scar tissue lined its cheeks where the child frequently used to scratch at its eyes, hoping to make some colour in the darkness, but, as always, the darkness pressed in again, filling its retinas. It was inevitable that the child' s madness would turn to despair. As it fell to its knees, it gave one last howling cry of sadness. It cried for the mother it never had, the light it never saw and the love it never felt. As the howl faded to snuffling sobs, the child wrapped up within itself, drawing its knees to its chest, arms wrapped around close. As it did, the skin of the child began to flicker and crackle. The child' s eyes glazed over. As it let out one last despondent sigh, the air from its breath turned to fire, engulfing the child completely.

I knew for sure at least one of the guys in that room later became a junkie. Spend all his fortune on sequels, and then on fanfiction. \" Have you ever read one of those yourself? \" I ask my dealer. \" Yes, some, but I do not anymore. \" he says. \" Never read what you deal, that' s my rule. I do not try copying them either, that' s work for lab guys. So do you want to buy or not? This one is very good, first class. Guy won a bunch of awards, long time ago of course. \" I want to believe we have a special relationship, he and I. He is more interesting than the rich guys I normally hang with. But I know I am only a moneybag -- he would sell me without blinking if he had a buyer for information. In the evening, I sit alone near the fireplace, my parents on the work trip. How they can stomach the camps I have no idea. I long ago stopped believing they have anything resembling a human heart. I banish the though, shuffle the coals, try to relax. I open \" All You Wanted To Know About Gardening \". Let' s see if those awards are worth anything.",

It was easy for me to write because I already knew all the characters, the ship, the locations, etc., and I could just focus on telling a story. Obviously not everyone is going to be into Magic, or any one thing in particular, but you could probably find some fairly easy common ground for students to start with. Additionally, it' s nice when you' re first starting out to know that no one but your teacher is ever going to read your piece.

A joke unbiddenly enters your mind from your memory, it was told to you by Mum before your first election: You know why in Bavaria the CSU always wins? Because the pencil to fill out the ballot is tied so closely that it only suffices for the first candidate. You smile, the pencil is not tied to the booth here in NRW. You make two crosses: Erststimme ( SPD ), Zweitstimme ( Linke ). Tactically split to emply your wish for a coalition. A slight pang in your conscience because you never split your vote when you were young, but these days you no longer see the need to waste your Erststimme on a long shot.

Just to make sure I was n' t wrong about my theory, I took Freddie' s beer and emptied it in the bathroom sink. When I got back he had his hand raised to his mouth and head leaned back, as if he was drinking the same beer I just poured out. He was crazy about his beer, especially the finer Pilsners. If I sit back down in the chair now, do they notice what happened or not? I hinged back the tall glass to Freddie hand, and unhooked Chloe' s bra for good measure, and sat down. \" Dude, Jim, what the fuck!? I paid good money for that! Buy your own beer. \" Freddie gestured accusingly towards Jim, who seemed to have his attention somewhere else and Chloe just sat there with her bra unhooked as if nothing happened.

These are just my preferences, but I wanted to get that out of the way first. I really enjoyed the reveal about how Malcolm had deduced that the valuable cargo he was being commissioned to deliver was probably a shipment of slaves. You know something is up when he' s getting the shit beat out of him and still refuses to take the deal. Up until that point, it sounded like a pretty good ( if shady ) deal! I was like, \" Why would n' t this dude just sign the paper?! \" But he knew something that I did n' t, and I really liked that the reader has to think about why Malcolm would willingly lose teeth over the matter ( the establishment of \" regen \" technology prevents Malcolm from looking uncharacteristically like a martyr -- he is a criminal, after all -- but the ability to heal quickly had n' t been explicitly introduced yet ). Another thing I liked is that even though Detective Singleton is female, she' s not a love interest. That makes sense, of course, because she and Malcolm are on opposite sides of the law, but I' m still glad to see that the story did n' t veer into \" star-crossed lovers \" territory or even have a hint of belligerent sexual tension, which it easily could have done. It was clear when Malcolm let her confront Norton by herself that they were just temporary allies. One minor thing: I noticed the word \" hissed \" a few times, and the character named Hess hissed at least once. Immediately after one of his lines you said, \" hissed Hess, \" which just sounds weird to me. Again, not a major thing.",

Inside, Anger had already passed on. He was the first to go, as the emotion that vanished with age. Fear was the main driving emotion these days, ever since Anger had gone. What would happen to Riley? Disgust was also near vanishing; it tended to happen when people aged. As you grow old, you see too much, and it was hard to not be desensitized to the things people did. Joy and Sadness were holding hands. It was bittersweet; two opposing emotions somehow coming together. They watched quietly as Disgust slowly disappeared; Riley was reaching the end of her life. Fear smiled at the two friends and then, too, flickered and vanished. The memories that once belonged to these emotions all turned grey. Sadness looked over at Joy, and squeezed her hand softly. As Riley' s heartbeat slowed to a constant buzz, they gasped. All the memories had turned into a vibrant yellow, as glaring as the sun. In the hospital room, Riley smiled, recalling all the events - Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust that had happened in her life. For some reason, none of that mattered anymore: she was at peace with her life. Sadness and Joy, still holding hands, slowly winked out of existence.

The ingenuity of these humans to control these animals for food production was astounding. But as time marched on, I could no longer respect the humans. Year after year, month after month, day after day, and hour after hour, I listen to the multitudes of death that occur every second. Cows, whose young was taken for veal and whose only purpose is to produce milk, grow old, and die. They would call out to all their children that were taken away. Chicken, forced into cages to lay eggs, would speak only of gibberish at the end of their lives. Their stories, heartbreaking as it is, only laid the foundation of anger. These livestock was forced into servitude and death not of their own choice, but only because they could be easily exploited. While I listened to their stories, I asked simply if they could change the world, would they do so for the better. These humans have created death factories for the carcasses of these animals. No, I can no longer respect humans. It is to this end, I have finally amassed enough angry spirits to take vengeance upon this world.

That' s what I get for trying to be a good person. Did n' t even get a thank you. Instead, I got one of the most horrified looks I' ve ever seen after I had taken a raider \" s knife to the shoulder. From what I could tell, she was one of those vault dwellers. And she looks like she had just been through hell. It could n' t have been easy for a girl alone in all this. She freaked out when I tried to patch her up which led me to believe that might' ve been sexually assaulted. But that does n' t excuse her from shooting me in the back when I turned around. It' s an interesting final view of the world lying face down. But I am pain free which is more than I can say for most. I am starting to hallucinate now as I see my vision flicker and a damage report scrolls along my right eye. What a strange fucked up world. I am done with it all.",

        "text": "Usually it' s something simple. Some sort of mundane task that no one wants to do but still needs to be done. You might have to clean the showers or haul manure- both disgusting jobs, but not impossible. Everyone had to earn their keep, and everyone had a job to do. Once you turn 18, it' s a new one every day. You never know what it will be, but you do know one thing: fail, and you will die. That is life in the community. Everyone must contribute. If you do n' t complete your task, you will be executed. I woke up this morning, saw the note laying on my bedside table. White paper with my name hastily scrawled upon it, same as every morning. I did n' t look at it right away, instead taking a moment to sit up and stretch my muscles, enjoying the cool morning air creeping across my skin. Finally, I was ready to take on whatever task I had today. The note unfolded in my hands. *Whistle* Instantly my blood froze. It had to be some sort of sick joke, this could n' t be my task. It had to be a mistake. It was n' t a joke, the writing on the page was so familiar to me, having seen it etched upon these notes for years. But why? Why would they have given me this task? I can not whistle. Years ago, my tongue was sliced to prove a point to my parents. They ended up executed regardless, but my tongue never fully healed. Whistling had been impossible since, as well as other vocal manipulations. Some days, it was hard just to talk. Whoever had made me receive this task clearly wanted me dead. Why? No reason came to mind- my parents were already gone, and I had done all I could to avoid following their footsteps. I was perfectly obedient to the community, ever servant, always completing my tasks- there was no reason I deserved this. I would have until nightfall to complete my task, but there was no need; I could already feel the noose tightening around my neck. I can not whistle, and today I die.",

I' m just a dude living in central Canada whose been thinking of a book idea non stop for the past 2 weeks or so. I do a lot of daydreaming and story/worldbuilding and this is the first story I have this much confidence in. Now onto the actual story. The story takes place following great war which destroyed major Canadian cities, and follows the resulting life of a young man ( let' s call him John ) who survives for many years in the remains of Winnipeg, Manitoba using the knowledge his father had given him all throughout his life. Through many events that happen after the war, John will slowly transform from a normal survivor into a feared local legend known as \" The Bear Man \". I want the story to follow intimately with John' s struggle to survive and the transformations he must go through and decisions he must make. It will probably focus on the feelings of isolation, longing for the past, loss of humanity and the effects of becoming a feared entity for people around you. Also, because the actual day to day surviving is a large aspect, I want to make sure that the John' s survival remains realistic for the most part, meaning I' ll focus on the aspects of food, shelter, cleanliness, injuries etc. It' s got a long way to go but I feel like it has a good premise and I' ve thought of events that can happen throughout the story.",

Masses of shoppers were drawn by a deep beckon to him, their minds slipping away into his poetries. They were his slaves, and the town lulled baying under his will. Jets and tanks closed in fast, three hours after the destruction of the National Space Centre, they were upon Leicester. Bombs and missles rocked the fleshy mass of R' nazugath, he laughed beastly. Tanks were batted aside by wild animals from the zoo filled with dark magics. After third day of siege the demon lord looked over his new kingdom with pride, rocket barrages had done nothing to his unholy flesh. A glint in the sky above the Clock Tower alerted him. It fell at divine speeds and the time around it slowed. The demon lord locked eyes with oblivion and he knew, powers beyond mortal or immortal conception closed closer to destroying him. He screamed with fear as he was disintegrated by nuclear force. His demonic hide obliterated and skewn particulates amongst the rubble of Leicester. In then years they built a memorial to the destruction of Leicester. A great doric column stood in the middle of the old town centre. It' s base, just standing above the steeple of the old demonic fortress' highest tower.

The living room is barren, and all memories of my life are gone. This pain stings more than any nuclear blast ever will. My children will never see their father again. All they will know is concrete, stale food, and an irradiated wasteland. I clasp my hands together and do somthing I have n' t for years. Pray. I pray to anyone who listens. I pray not for me, but for my children. My wife. I open my eyes and look outside. And for a moment, the bright light looks inviting. Like the hands of God. I smile.",

For some reason the idea of season tickets to The Sabers floats to the surface, hockey always seemed to be the thing that you and Brad had most in common. The suspense is too much, the thought of getting back on the elevator and opening it in your apartment is too much, it' s simply too long of a wait! Here in the lobby you tear the fine gold paper along the seam. As the envelope splits open you have no time to react, blue and silver glitter covers your shirt and pants. There in the lobby you stand in the mess, dumbfounded. Some teenagers come into the lobby with their longboards, they whisper and laugh as they get on the elevator. Your face feels hot.

Granted the markings had changed from letters to their own unique system, and the pillars were replaced with grey and clear. I had the foresight to leave myself a pack for this, and hurriedly changed. While the nip in the air would not kill me, another seeing me with no coverings in winter would bring out... unwelcome attention. My plan was the same as every full moon, walk around the city that was beginning to encroach my forest, and I jinxed myself by believing the night would be mishap free. As it were and often is, there was another plan in place. The smell came first. While dulled, it was still sharper than most of my current-kin. Fear, especially, was potent enough to smell even among the cold smell of forest. Instinct kicked in, as I recognized it as the fear of something young. Something that, no matter what I looked like, was encoded in me to protect. I was already running toward the source when the scream made it easier to pinpoint.",

He said his girlfriend needed to go there anyways, and was planning a trip to Cellular Care; they do a bunch of stuff there I guess with genes and such.

She had some money saved up, so it was nice that way, because I had - as I pulled out all six drawers and placed them on my bed, shuffling the underwear and shirts around – less than nothing. Not only did I have nothing, but I found four bills after checking every socket and cuff. The bills: my tab at McKinney' s place, and I had to pay that one, the first payment expected for my school loans, typed and signed by the financial manager, who I knew well, and who knew I only joined the college because I had wanted to play Riddle Ball in a more organized environment. The other two were torn up, so I could n' t tell or remember what they were. On the morning of day four, Al and I set out to find some money. I told Al to carry the bag of antiques because he was the stronger one, but he said his shoulder wasn' t feeling right, so I lugged it over my right shoulder and we set out towards the shops. We walked for a few minutes, but Al needed to take a break and get his brain feeling good with some pills, \"Life' s too slow man. I get bored by walking.

But of course, Jimmy did n' t mind any of that, since he was a horse. But still, he began thinking. Why could n' t Jimmy just parade himself around, and offer his services to the children without interfering? So Jimmy tried that, but no one would give him any money. \" It must be the top hat \" Jimmy thought to himself. But Jimmy knew he could not afford a top hat. So he asked the man with the hat how he got his hat, to which he simply replied \" I got it from my parents \". \" But how did your parents get the hat then? \" Jimmy asked. \" They got it from their parents \", the man replied. \" But who did they get it from? \". \" They stole it. \". And there, Jimmy saw what he had to do. Jimmy immediately murdered the man with the hat, and took his hat, and uknowingly sparked a revolution, which is why, that if you visit Horseville today, the horses will be wearing their own hats.",

The only way to explain what happened next is to say he began \" shifting \". He began to bleed through the fabric of the universe. And like that he was gone. A few moments later he returned with a rather homely looking woman. In a big booming voice he announced, \" This is the ugliest woman in all the multiverse. She is known as u/ImTroll' s mother. I will prove to you that I am the most powerful being, worthy of at least a power rating of 10. I will do this by having sex with her and not vomitting everywhere. Tobias began. He was going strong. Spectators began to walk out, unable to watch the horrifying display. The level indicator began ticking from 1 to 7, very rapidly. And slowly it turned over to an 8. But then something happened he did n' t expect. He began to feel weak. And his pace slowed along with the rising level indicator. Tobias yelled, \" I' m like a flashbang going off in a small room! \" Tobias felt a cold hand grab him by the scruff of his neck. Then, he felt himself being pulled in close to his partner. And in his ear she whispered, \" your purpose is limited and your novelty account is gay. \"",

I' ve lived a long life of being down on my luck. I have no home, no kids, no friends, no family, nothing. I was born into this world without any real care or responsibilities. I was bullied all the time, and shoved aside for those who can buy happiness. One day I decided to change that. The first one was for Phantom of the Opera. I broke the Prima Donna' s leg. It was easy. I set up the chandelier to fall on top of her during rehearsal. No one expected a thing. It collapsed right on top of her just like I planned. Christine, the angel, was able to proceed as the new breakout. I was so happy for her. She' s now at Broadway performing for nearly every act. I could n' t be more proud. This is my life.

You mentioned this in your post, but for me it' s always useful to think of the backgrounds of characters and how they relate. This sort of flows into my dialogue prompt but also flows into sort of shading or fleshing out characters that is so hard to do. Not everyone can be orphaned as a baby or have some sort of vendetta. They can just be bored in their own lives, or searching for happiness. And not only that, that characters do n' t only do good or evil things. You touch on this in the' POV matters' and that' s totally true. But someone who' s good does n' t do all good things. You and I have both done things we regret. Those things stick with us. So the biggest piece of advice that I can give ( sorry to jump on here ) is to make sure that your ( at least human characters ) have human characteristics. Not just Mary-Sue type things in that they' re good at everything, but also that they' ve had their ups and downs. Everyone weathers storms. Everyone gets in fights. Everyone does n' t look where they' re going and rams their knee into a desk ( at least once... maybe ). Excellent guide.

On the other side of the yard, he had almost already had his spell charged, by the looks of it, a powerful lightning bolt. Just as the spell was about to be unleashed, I gave him a small tickling behind his head. This broke his spell. I took the time to make a huge tickling affect on him. He dissolved in tears of laughter to the ground. He managed, somehow, to make a small deflecting shield around him. I turned off the spell. I then realised that the power of the shield was obviously weak. I put all of my remaining power into making the spell pierce the shield. We both got hit to some degree and fell to the ground laughing once again. He finally stood up and shook my hand, declaring the duel a stalemate and me to be the world number two battle mage.",

The entire world came together as we built the first ships and colonized the moon. The asteroid belt was mined clean and in the following decade the planets of our system were mined for resources as our first FTL ships scouted the nearby star systems, ever careful of giving ourselves away to those who might be watching. Building on their technology we became masters of stealth, perfecting ships that their most advanced sensor technology could not detect. Our first forays out of the buffer zone was in sending our stealthiest craft to capture nearby vessels, pulling them into the buffer zones like high tech trapdoor spiders. These pirated vessels were stripped and studied, their stunned crews interrogated. We learned their latest tech while we colonized every star system we could within the buffer. We used the resources to build an armada and spent the next decade training the best navy the galaxy had ever seen. Today, I stand on the bridge of the lead ship as admiral of the Terran Fleet.

We' ve learned so much these last few years. We all go through a sort-of mid-Apocalypse-life crisis. It' s not just the realization that you WILL die and that you do n' t know exactly when -- - it' s knowing that with almost complete certainty HOW you' re going to go. So that' s where I am. And just as we all expect, it happened with a bite. But what I did n' t expect is how calm I feel about it all. I thought for years that I' d punch my own time card, you know, clock out early. I' ve got nothing against suicide. I' m not particularly religious either. It' s actually quite altruistic, not allowing yourself to be another of the countless undead. But altruism died with the first wave. I' ve propped myself right against this tree and I' m going to enjoy my last few breaths in this existence humming along to my favorite song. I' ve got reason to be happy though. I might not be necessarily alive in a few minutes, but being undead beats the hell out of being dead. \" Heeeeey Jude, do n' t make it baaaad. Just take a sad sooooong and make it better... \"",

At the appointed hour, the rulers of all the worlds under the Galactic Protectorate ( an equally grandiose term, for the same reasons cited above ), and all the rulers of the nations of Earth gathered in the stadium that hand been built for the occasion. In orbit, and beyond, a thousand ships sat watching. Our greatest fear was some lone actor or nation would view this as an opportunity for violence, and doom the planet. Some believed we were doomed anyway, and there was no shortage of talk regarding how we might strike one final blow for humanity on our way out.

Everywhere she could hear the sound of laughter trough the open windows, almost not recognizing the sound at first, so unfamiliar had she become with the sound of human joy. It had been almost 6 months since the bank foreclosed on their house, and 5 months since mom vanished. Dad had been unemployed for over a year now, and all he ever did was drink and yell. The first slap came when he was drunk, after that it did not matter if he was drunk or sober. The hitting continued. They lived in a small apartment. The hallways littered with graffiti and always smelling like filth. Sleep was difficult. Always the sound of sirens and screams cutting trough the thin walls and waking her up. The girl walked around the streets of the city. She had been told to gather up empty bottles, and anything else she could find of value. The snow was falling thick, her clothes thin. She knew that she could not return home empty-handed. She could not take another slap, not tonight. Not on New Years Eve. In the snow she found a blue lighter. The button pressed down and a small fire ignited in front of her eyes. In the fire she saw her family together around the tree on Christmas eve, laughing and hugging without a care in the world. The fire went out. In the next flame she saw her room. It was not big, but it was hers, she had ponies on the wall paper. The fire went out. The third flame, she saw her grandmother. The only person who had ever treated her nicely. The girl remembered her grandmother telling her about when a star shots across the heavens, it means a person has died and gone to heaven. She knew her grandmother was in heaven. She wished that she could see her again. The fire went out. The girl looked up at the night sky and just as she was about to close her eyes she saw a shooting star. She smiled. The fire went out.... The next day a man found the frozen body of a 9 year old girl. In her hand, a blue lighter.",

I had my baton, illegal of course, but in my hand it was my only weapon. My respirator mask, which seemed like such a hindrance just a moment before, proved to be my lifeline. I fought for my place. Most people did not have any protection against the poison in the air. Their flight turned to folly as they struck out at members of the group, and almost all of us were trying to get clear. I had to put one kid down and hit another stumbling past me. I hit another, and another. I was swinging wildly connecting with elbows and my truncheon, and getting hit in return. Someone pulled at my respirator, dangerously lifting it off the suction of my face, so I let myself be dragged down with it. I could not imagine losing it, taking it off my face. I needed to have it. A woman on the ground wanted it though. So I had to hit her, on the ground fast quick punches and chops, ‘ till she stopped moving.

It became a hobby as the threat of nuclear war departed. The humble start of a square room that smelled like wet grass and dirt became his underground center. Rooms for growing, rooms for living, recreational expanses for movies and bowling. It was more luxurious than his house in comparison to the amenities. Where his house was a simple one story unit house. It continued to grow and more money was spent keeping it pristine and safe from the local government from destroying it. His friends thought it was the best damn place to host a party. Turns out it was when Adam figured it might as well have been used. Others felt like it was crazy to build a little kingdom under the dirt. It felt weird to make a shelter from a threat long passed. It felt like it was something that was not needed. That is until threat returned. Friends to Adam hung closer to him with enemies closer. People stop criticizing and started praising. Adam felt a world on his shoulders. It came without any real warning. When his friends and enemies alike were feeling brave and secure. Adam went into his shelter while the world above roared and screamed. Years would pass and more until one day he found that the world above could suit him again. He was the first one to enter this new world. Adam searched and search and cried out.

One does not become ruler of the world without being incredibly powerful, but they insisted, they said with the disappearance of his right hand man they could fight him, they left, I gave them my raft and wished them the best. I had told myself I would n' t follow them, that I would let them die at his hands. I had lied, I usually did. I looked away from the crystal and left my home. It had taken years to construct with no reasonable magic to aid me, I tried to keep it camouflaged, and at the end of those three months I managed it. A fine home, decorated with pearls from the mollusks around the island' s shallows and crystals from the caves. It was nice, to have built something for once. To create instead of destroy. Of course without my raft I was without my transport. I glanced around looking for an answer, I knew what had to be done, but I did not like it. Of course, I worked past it, and I turned on my heel. I obliterated my house in an instant, my work shattering to pieces, pearls splintered and crystal shattered around me, the door was reduced to little more than fiber. And as the chaos settled, one wall was intact, one I had made to remain intact. I lifted it from the sand, muscles honed from a year of hard living making it easy work. I took a wide stance and step by step made it to the sea, where I threw the wall into the surf. It bobbed briefly before settling on the surface. I stepped onto it, carefully, and I balanced carefully in the middle. I reached behind myself with both hands, fire licking my fingers. And I bid farewell to my island. Fire erupted from my shoulders, my hands no more than a memory. My feet remained steady on the raft, the force of my spell propelling me madly toward the mainland.

At the end of her arms, arms covered in fisherman nets and inking of sea life ending with rounded silver bracelets, carried a glowing wooden staff. The magical light emanating from the staff shone through the cracks in the bark - the blueness giving it a mystical effect. Her left hand started giving off a radiance of blue light, vaguely in the shape of sea lions spiraling around her open hand. An explosion of water burst from the tide and circled around Calypso' s body. The water formed into a face with two glowing blue eyes and an array of teeth. The rest of the water beast was still murky and undefined. Looking upon it you did n' t think that it could n' t hurt you. Those fangs, water they might be were still menacing.

For example, I was talking to a girl in school today and the \" awkward \" music came on. I knew this was my time to just roll out and leave her alone. The music would shut off when I went to sleep. I do n' t know if it actually shut off, or if I was just asleep and did n' t hear it. Either way, I would n' t hear it while I was asleep - or so I thought. I was awoken at 4: 00 AM by the loudest screeching noise that you could think of right now. Imagine your teacher with a chalk in her hand, writing on the chalkboard. Remember the little screeches? Now imagine that, but multiply the noise by almost 100 fold. That' s how I felt right now. I knew something was wrong, but what it could it be? I' ve never heard this music in my life before, and watching scary movies, I knew not to get up. But what did I do? That' s right - the stupidest thing. I got up. I still question to this day why I got up. It was probably the scariest thing I' ve ever seen in my life. As soon as I got up, the screeching sound disappeared. I was relieved, but what if it happens again? Who knew. Anyways, I really needed to use the washroom. I open up the lights, and half asleep I was peeing. It was only until I looked in the mirror I realized something was HORRIBLY wrong. I opened up my eyes a bit more, and there she was. Standing right behind me. Her hair covering her face but her laugh was the worst part of it all. I instantly fainted.

A prompt based on an Einstein quote regarding time relativity was the most obvious, receiving 300 upvotes and 40 stories involving time travel, and spaceships. By day 5, every story involved some mention of Hitler, immortality or Gods. By the time Monday rolled around, the mods decided to close the subreddit.

They were ruled by a king and a queen, and they each lived in a big castle with many servants and guards and ladies-in-waiting and squires. And they had a son, the prince, who also lived in a castle. But his castle was a ways away from theirs. The king ruled justly, and many people liked him Then, one day, from the east, there came four monsters, great dragons with skin made of steel and bellies ful of fire. The first some flew roaring towards the King' s castle and spewed fire at it, setting it ablaze as all the people of the kingdom watched in horror. They knew that dragons inhabited the lands to the east, but for a dragon to come here? It was unheard of and frightening. The second dragon set the Queen' s castle alight as well, and flew off, laughing as the castles crumbled to the ground, with many servants and guards and ladies-in-waiting and squires still inside. The third dragon attacked the Prince' s castle. But the castle was too large, so he set a wall on fire and left before the guards could kill him. The destruction caused by the dragons caused people to become very afraid. The markets closed as people rushed home to be with their families. But wait, what of the fourth dragon? He perished. He wished to burn down the villages. But the first villagers he tried to burn were brave, and fought against him. Finally, as he swallowed the last villager, the dragon fell, dead to the ground, as the last man cut the inside of his throat. To this day, we remember the destruction caused by the evil dragons. Their master is dead, but it will not bring the poor villagers and servants and guards and the others back. Because sadly, not every story has a happy ending.

My creators knew that no physical object could withstand the ebb and flow of time, so they built me to exist beyond this realm. They knew that their effort were pointless without anyone to appreciate their memory, so I was given thought. And so I was born. They called me an ark: a vessel to house their collected experiences, knowledge, memories, hopes, and dreams; I would remember them long after their people, their cities, their worlds had turned to dust. And so I did. For eons, I remembered them: I remembered all of their first steps, their first loves, their first heartbreaks, so on and so forth. Eventually, I can not say when, I became them: their first steps became mine, I shared their first loves and their heartbreaks, and on and on; my creator' s aspirations were now borne unto me. I looked on at my new dreams and memories and found something I did not anticipate: jealousy. Even though I shared their memories, I could never truly accept them as my own; *I* was not the one to kiss Melanie on the last day of high school, *I* was not the one who married Stephen against my parents' best wishes, *I* was not the one who made that perfect cake for Gramma Ly on her 75^th birthday, *I* was not the one who lived a life with ups and downs and twists and turns & mdash; *I* am merely a spectator in these events.

His eyes and ears were oozing into the pool around his head. I tasted metal and dust with the grit crunching against my teeth as I swallow.

The cracks danced around the rest of his body -- the light' s shadow defining more than others. A mucusy film had begun to be secreted along some of the more significant fissures. His head turned to face me. He whimpered. His left arm scraped towards my right -- our weapons wherever. I intercepted it, he stopped. My hand embraced his claw. He whimpered. His whimpering intensified, almost becoming crying. I took my hand back. I moved it to my chest. The vest felt crispy as I ran my hand over the breast pockets, searching for the smooth cylinder. I pulled it out, weekly grasping at it. I shuffled my shoulders towards him, the movement and deep breathes spasmed my chest. I looked to his face again. My arm with cylinder approached the rubbery connection between his head skeleton and body. His breathing became more shallow, his weak crying jagged with grating sounds. I pushed it in further and pressed the button at the end. It hissed, he hissed. I moved my hand back to his as the crying became whimpering, which became silence.

We set up in an ambush position near the stairs so either of us could attack as it came past. I' d never killed anything before, what would it be like? As we crouched quietly my mind again wandered off. What is going on? I could n' t answer as I did n' t know but the smell got worse so the creature was close. Player 1 launch out at the creature, stabbing wildly with his knife piercing the flesh of the thing with howls of pain. I jumped up to help but something held me back. I tried swinging my arm holding the clever but it could n' t move. Was I just scared senseless? Was I caught on something? The answer came quickly, as I turned to see the razor sharp claws swing towards my throat. As my life slowed and my blood pulsed down my body to the floor, I realised.... fuck, there were two of them.",

Rain was on its way. Chester Street had once been a hive of activity, people lining the streets in search of fresh pastries or trinkets sold by the old gypsies who seemed to have been around for as long as Bart could remember. Now it was empty of such life. He passed an old general store, robbed and ransacked long ago. The door banged loudly as it swung on its hinges with the wind blowing a gale down the road. Bodies lay stacked against the walls, an almighty stench reaching his nostrils despite the scarf. A decrepit old man lay contorted in the gutter, clutching at the cobblestones. Bart took a wide berth around him but paused a moment to observe the struggle. Help, he seemed to mime as he reached for Bart' s shoe. Help. In a nonchalant fashion he stepped over the man' s hand and continued on his way, tightening the scarf around his face as he went. They called it the Black Plague, but he knew it simply as death.",

In fact, if you looked up, you could see his massive, burning body hurdling towards Earth.

Starting with infamous line \" My anaconda do n' t want none if you aint got buns hun \" The famous giant anaconda snake is a symbol of Brazil. This lyric highlights the tragic brazillian dependance on US aid and shunning of local produce. But it' s a little known fact just who that voice belongs to. It is in fact the voice of a famous 20th century philosopher known only as Sir Mixalot. Most of his work has been lost to time but he is famed for his inability to lie. This choice of speaker gives the song a distinct undertone of honesty, ethics and integrity. \" I let him hit it cus he sling cocaine \". At first listen this line may sound like gibberish to our modern ears. However sling is an old colloquial term for throwing and cocaine was a deadly illegal drug that plagued the streets of Oil age America. So it appears Nicki allowed this man to discipline her pet snake because he works in law enforcement discarding cocaine. \" I got a big butt \". Now butts are one part of a type of primitive gunpowder weapon very popular at the time. In this line she is implying that she is very well armed. Presumably for the fending off of criminals. The deranged laughter at the beginning of the line highlights the giddy thrill of controlling such ( for the time ) powerful weaponry. I conclude that this song is about resisting the decay of civilization. It is nothing more or less than a great rallying cry against crime and injustice. With any luck this epic ballad of courage will echo through the generations and be heard in our own time.",

After much experimental and under-the-radar testing, they are confident that it will be able to be installed in every business place and household through the country, and perhaps even the world. Lead scientist Doctor Kingsley Gallbatorix stated: \" This device is small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. We have yet to give it a name, but we are expecting to begin mass production and distribution soon. We hope it will aid our country in this time of internal struggle. \" This all coming out only a few days after several states in the South band together to try to secede from the government. Could it be a coincidence, or is the government taking control to a new level: into our heads?",

His eyesight also teetered on the edge of darkness, his skin was a pale white from bloodloss and his legs shook as if he had just squatted over his max by a few hundred tons. \" Art thou ready to face your doom forsaken traveler?! \" The ominous voice was punctuated by the sideways slash of an impossibly large sword. Towering above him the fallen one walked slowly to the platform, from the cracks of his red hellstone armor tendrils of flames leaked seeking more victims and his visor itself expelled smoke that smelt of elderberries. \" Your head shall be my greatest trophy! \" He lifted his arm and crushed his hand into a fist which trembled with rage. \" NOW FIGHT ME! \" The guardian moved with unnattainable grace as his armored legs rang with clangorous joviality.

This increase would be greater, if it were n' t for the one thing we value more than a human life: Money. Money is what holds us back as a species. We are willing to do pathetic, senseless and degrading acts against humanity in pursuit of such wealth. We murder other human beings for money. Money governs society. In turn, society develops around economy, and some nations have become run by the corporations that earn for it. Powerful countries exploit weaker ones for their resources, preventing their advancement. We have the capacity to develop so much faster, yet we are held back by those in pursuit of materialistic gains.

He flipped the page, and a hand-written note was the only thing remaining before the back end of the folder.' Dear Gifters, I' m Nick. I died of cancer at the age of 17. My only regret is that I never had enough time in my life to do things, and I wanted to make sure that nobody in the future would ever have that issue. The Council told me to apply to be a Gifter, and since you were the original, I sent it to you, St Nicholas.

Joe is knocking on my door. \" Give me an Acid Bath, make it toasty. \" I ordered the hostess as I took my seat ib the local bar. My drink appeared almost as soon as the words left my mouth. I took a sip, then a gulp, then downed the whole damn thing. I had a hunch this was the last one Id have for a while. The bar grew deathly quiet and I knew my doom had come. I took one last puff on my *etyul* and slowly turned around. The last thing I saw before I lost conciousness was one of those damn humans with some black suit, a cape, and pointy ears. He looked rediculous. *wrote this on mobile, sorry about minor mistakes*",

She said she' d be back the next day for the trash. The wrestling kept going for a few more hours, then switched to some program about cars. I watched it. I' ve seen it before. She did come back, but she did n' t take the trash out. The bags have been stacked in the kitchen for a week now. It smells a bit. She sat down next to me. We watched TV some more. Re-runs of *The Office*. I only really like the ones with Stanley in, but he was n' t in any of these. Mom tried to go, but did n' t. She asked me lots of questions, but Seinfeld was on, so I did n' t say much. She cried a bit. After that I fell asleep. When I woke up, she was on the phone. Talking to Dad, I guess. The TV was playing wrestling again. It' s all fake. If you watch it enough, you can see that. Dad turned up a bit later. He tried to shake Mom, wake her up. It did n' t work. After a bit, he sat down too. He kept trying to stand back up. Eventually, he just sat there, head in hands, while the blonde lady talked about buying artificial diamonds and timeshares. Dad used to get really angry about that, called it a scam. He did n' t this time. He just sat there, next to Mom. Yesterday, the power went out. Guess I forgot to pay the bill. Mom and Dad do n' t seem to mind. They have n' t said anything in a while. I guess someone else will come at some point. Maybe they' ll take the trash out, check on Mom and Dad.

It always surprises people when I tell them this, but nothing puts some colour in a man' s voice like the grief of a nation. Vietnam was next. That took a bit more effort from all of us but how else could we have got a white man to sing rock and roll like that. We did n' t start that war but we sure did our best to keep it going when we saw the effect it was having on his voice. Richard was the masterstroke. We' d always called him tricky dicky since he started with us but his early attempts had failed. It' s not hard to see how you go from Viva Las Vegas to Promised Land via Watergate.

The African Union has been threatening the Strait since Spain captured Isla de Alborán as a naval base with the backing of NATO in direct violation of the Treaty Of Tangier. The Soviet Union has been working with the U. N. as an arbitrator between the European Powers and the A. U. but the United States has accused the Soviet Union of having ulterior motives since a conference in Tokyo where Soviet Academics talked about worsening relationships between Africa and Europe making fertile ground for a socialist revolution, First Secretary Khrushchev dismissed the comments as being \"... just hypothetical musings of scholars, something the Soviet Union encourages... \". The U. N. also hopes to resolve the fate of the stateless Boer people who were expelled out of Africa along with other European peoples from Zimbabwe and Algeria after the introduction of Cairo Accord which stripped citizenship and expelled ancestors of European colonists still living on the Continent. Currently no nation has agreed to take in ten thousand displaced people who currently reside in displaced persons camps in Brazil who have made moves to close the camps and move the people on stating \" we believe we have no responsibility to these people and that the nations that placed their ancestors in Africa should repatriate them \".

If you do n' t like all the damned noise, stop pushing the limits.' Despite the odd interruption, I followed the instructions as though I had heard this uninvited voice before.

Other large cities started to follow - no murders for week. For a month. For months. Were the cops no longer working? Reporters and civilians spent nights doing ride-alongs with cops, to verify and discover what the police had seen all along. People were dying, but they were dying of other causes. There were no knife marks, no bullet wounds, no bruises from force, no poisons introduced. There were no homicides. People disappeared though. It' s not many people who want to kill others, so it took a while to figure out what was going on. Street gangs eventually disappeared. Abusive spouses disappeared. Those were the first you' d notice. Then it became more subtle. Some people you would just never see again. No one knew who took them or why, but we all figured they were someone who would want to murder. So it' s now just us. The one' s who are left. We all realize that the ones taken were angrier. Some say they were more passionate and more feeling, and really the only ones left are the ones that are easiest to control, because we' ll never fight against anything.

At least the changing scenery was interesting while it lasted. Now that I' m finally leaving the arm of the galaxy, I probably won' t be seeing anything but blackness for a while. Eternity in the blackness of space. If that doesn' t scare you then nothing will. In retrospect, it was mostly my fault that things turned out this way.

For a long while now, He had contemplated the true state of the world, and what must be done; each of these were on the brink of happening, and yet they were among His faithful? Time was at a stand-still before Him, all realities coming to a halt as He pondered what may be done. Lifting a mighty hand, He parted the cloudy skies over a world entrenched in sorrow, and for a moment hesitated, but knew all would be understood. This was never a part of His plan, but neither was seeing His sole divine creation turn to a wasteland riddled with contempt and dread. The world would most definitely be better off, able to live in what He believed would be Earthly Paradise before those true to His lessons would be ushered to the Pearly Gates.

There is no sign of us on the generals maps, the Germans can´t attack it because they have no spies to tell them we are here and the rest of the Army would shoot us or join us depending on their point of view if they knew we existed.

Sure, the pay is bad and the food too, but we do not dig trenches and we have some nice facilities here.

Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child.

He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled.

When the CEO started talking, Jack focused hard at his face, trying to get a clear shot. He raised his hands and extended them forward, palms glowing white.

One by one, he saw everyone he ever loved melt away. His father. His mother. He saw his friends, gathered around an open casket. Inside was his own corpse.

Jack giggled, not having to stifle his laughter anymore. He levitated out th window, crossing a name off his list. Jack was the Chosen One. His powers were unstoppable. He could be whatever he wanted. Obviously, whoever was doing the choosing made a mistake. That was clear to Jack, at least. Life was a role-playing game to him.

Otherwise the \" single action, make peace \" line was kind of clunky, it may have worked better to have Fletcher explain what single action meant earlier on so that it was in the readers head towards the end. In the final conversation Conall probably talked a little bit too much. There seemed to be lines that did n' t really seem like things he would say and were more there to set up Colm. Other than that there were a couple minor things. There' s that darkly comedic line towards the end where you could probably drop \" do you think? \" and there were a couple of similes and metaphors that came off as awkward to me, for example \" the chastised face of a small child caught pilfering cookies from a jar \" or \" it felt sour and sugary, like lemon in a glass of water \", but I' m pretty much allergic to similes that are n' t played for humour so I' d especially take that with a grain, or shaker, of salt. Again I would n' t say any of these were major ( or even valid ) and it was very well written.",

The Earth simply can not withstand the current population of 11, 000, 000, 000 souls. The taxation on the environment is outrageous. The ladies and gentlemen of this committee have asked me for a solution; in this message is the solution. How does one go about eradicating the human race? We' re certainly too advanced for a disease to make any sort of a dent in the population. If we were to simply begin culling people by force, a war may ensue - one that would n' t leave two stones standing on top of each other. Other methods are simply too unreliable or inexpensive - nanobots and killer AI come to mind. Albert Einstein once said, \" Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I' m not sure about the former. \" and this rings true. The truth is, most human beings are stupid. We can educate ourselves, but, as another saying goes, \" you ca n' t fix stupid \".... Which is the crux of my position. If we remove the warning signs from hazardous pieces of equipment and machinery, people will die in droves. The amount of fools slicing their own arteries with lawn-mowers, and falling from construction cranes will greatly decrease our population. Without safety warnings or manuals, society degrades. Thank you kindly for considering my proposal.",

Both of them lived alone, which Bruce decided was a good first talking point. They spoke for a while, about living alone, about being lonely, about their parents. Bruce had the bright idea, at the end of the date, to suggest they head back to his place for, as he called it,' netflix and chill'. The girl, who he found out was named Lilly, gave a look of indignation, but only for a moment. She grinned and offered a counter-suggestion- head to her place and' water her plants'. Bruce grinned and helped her out to his car. The two arrived at her place. She had been quiet the drive back- another clue Bruce should have been aware of- but he was too excited about the upcoming activities. She asked him if he was thirsty- he said yes. She headed in to the kitchen, and Bruce heard her mutter something. He dismissed it, and she came out with a clear blue liquid, very much like the color of blue kool-aid. He accepted it graciously and drank it all at once, then asked where the plants were that needed watering. She responded it was coming in soon.

Wearing long, dark clothes, it was impossible to identify his features. The brim of his hat was wide, his face in total shadow.

Play nice with them, as your shared experiences and heritage are all that you have with each other. In an ever-changing world, you will only have each other to anchor you down. Bad men and women have taken over this country, and they hate people like us. They have convinced many of our friends to turn on us for who we are. Our sole crime: being Calabrese. In Rodenas Square, innocent Calebreseians are being cruelly hurt by a group of Lapumas. This country is not the country that you know. This is not the country that I knew when I was young. It has changed for the worse, and our welcome has been determined to be overstayed. Maybe one day, when all of this is over, things can return back to normal. Lapumas and Calebresians can one day live together in peace again and you will be able to play with little Sammy again. But until that day comes, you must stay strong. You must look out for yourself, and your cousins, and other Calebresians. I do n' t expect you to understand any of this. This world is very harsh and unforgiving. But remember that I will always love you and I am proud of how tough you are. Your father, your mother, and I will always be watching over you. You are our sweet sunshine and no one can take that away from you. Your loving uncle, Milan Cutro PS: If you can, avoid Campbell Hollow. It may seem like it' s a warm and inviting settlement, but no Calabresian who entered has ever gotten out.",

Henry sat down in a chair and placed his face in his hands. His tears slowly pooled. How could this be? He did n' t understand why he felt this great sinking feeling of grief, deep in his heart. This did n' t make sense after all. He picked up the letter off the floor, and re-read it. \" Henry, have a seat. I know you do n' t realize this now, but I' m sure you' ve been feeling strange. You are home. Take it easy, relax and go to bed. Call Mary in the morning. Let her know the dementia is getting worse. If you' re wondering why the money is gone, you gave it to David, your son, to deposit and manage for you. I realize that you are feeling quite confused, but do n' t worry. We will get through this. Just trust in me and trust in yourself. Signed, Henry \" He picked up his grease pencil and went over to the desk. His heart felt bruised, and his hand felt heavy. His tears dripped onto the paper as the grease pencil left it' s marks. \" Henry, You may have seen this letter before, but please call Mary. Let her know how much you miss her while you remember. She gave you the best years of her life, but she just could n' t take it anymore. Call her while you can. Write a letter to remind yourself. \" He picked up his tools, placed everything in the bag. he placed the letter in his shirt pocket and walked out towards the living room. In the corner, was his favorite chair. He threw the bag into the closet, and sat down. He pulled out the letter and read it again. This time, his heart did n' t feel as burdened.",

Always my neighbours playing their music too loud or a car speeding past on the motorway blaring a red streak of car horn noise in the air. Kills me. Prickles the back of my neck, makes the inside of my eyes burn like a cluster headache. I think of an ocean, of word variations causing spontaneous teleportation. You' d go from your computer chair to fathoms deep and drown still swimming for the surface. That' s especially morbid, I note. Good job, but too loud to write it. Still, it niggles at my mind. My coffee machine is going off, shrill as a mother in law, calling for dinner. I make a show of getting up, switching it off, returning to my seat. I smooth the pleather. I tap twice. As I drink my coffee I realise that the final act of switching the button on the coffee machine off has made it completely silent in the apartment I rent. A coursing of absolute joy swims through my veins, fishing for compliments at just how good I am at creating a perfect atmosphere for creation. Well done me, I think, and cheerily sip my coffee. It takes me fifteen minutes to realise that the lovely absence of noise is the absence of me breathing, the absence of my heart beating.",

The night after our first date, we chatted online, and he admitted that he had wanted to put his arm around me the previous night. I told him he should have.

I told him he should have. On our third date, we knew what was going to happen.

For a while, after, she thought the procedure hadn' t worked, that she was still tasting things.

Eventually she forgot the Taste of even things which had been her favorites as a child. It wasn' t so much of a loss. Then, after what felt like centuries and seconds simultaneously, she was nineteen, and had to start deciding. Smell was the next logical choice, she decided. The Order most followed was Smell, Taste, Feeling, Hearing, Sight. Some chose to switch Hearing and Sight, if they were losing one more rapidly. Of course, many didn' t follow the Standard. It was illegal to chose to lose Feeling before the age of Thirty, too harmful to a child' s psychology to lose it at Ten, and with the overpopulation problem being a thing of the past, seeing as living to Sixty was a myth, with no Sense to give up, they wanted people to procreate. It had been found many wouldn' t do it when they lacked pleasure, so they couldn' t lose it at Twenty either. So her choices were Sight, Hearing, or Smell. So Smell it was. While it would help save money, she would still miss the candles, since once one lost Smell it was only logical to trade out candles as a primary light source for flashlights.",

The defending champions India are playing against first timer Germans in this epic battle of world dominance. Germany' s impossible path to finals has been a truly exciting journey. The team which was not even qualified for world cup got last minute invitation, due to sudden withdrawal of Afghanistan. and Germany with its imported players from India set out to prove themselves under the captaincy of Asif Khan. They had bested Bangladesh, Scotland, New Zeeland and England to reach qualifiers. They had trashed Pakistan to get to semi-finals, and won by just 2 runs against Shri Lanka to get to the finals. And here they are just six runs way from victory with one ball remaining and eight wickets down. They are facing mighty Indians. This is unbelievable moment for fans all over the world. Pakistan had found themselves at similar situation all those world cups ago, and WON. Now the question remains, can they do it? can Germans hit the finals boundary for maximum runs and win the world cup. Indian medium pacer, Bhuwaneshwar kumar taking his run up. All the mighty batsman have bowed before kumar before. odds are highly stacked against German batsman Shafraz Samsudeen. Shafraz the only real german in the team has no previous experience of batting internationally. The presure is ginormous. Kumar bowls full toss, Shafraz swings the bat blindly and....

He should have known that I was a man that wore these bars around his heart long before this physical incarceration. I was a prisoner of my own making, and that is unforgivable. The irony of it all is that I felt most alive just before the sirens and the handcuffs. No, I wo n' t move. My skin will fade to the colour of these concrete walls. My spirit will dim to the wattage of the bulbs swinging from the hallway beyond these bars. I will allow this to happen because in truth I have already allowed it to happen long before the fall of the gaval and the clang of my cell door. When two paths diverged in the wood of my life, I took the one most traveled by. I always charted the middle path. I fell in line with the endless trains of the faithless. And that has made all the difference. I lacked any difference from anything else. An old man once told me that if you stay in one place too long you become that place. He was a rock of a man, but at least a heart pounded in his chest. At least he lived. And so, in spite of the pleading heart of my well-meaning guard, I will become this place. I deserve this place.",

His head was filled with images of a strange, bearded man in a dark room, coupled with feelings of intense pain that even now made his lip quiver. He walked through the field and saw a human figure in the distance, kneeling down in front of something. Curiosity struck the boy, and he wandered toward the scene. As he grew closer he made out his father' s face, red and stained with tears. In front of him was a stone structure surrounded with beautiful flowers of all colors. The boy was overwhelmed with concern; he had never seen his father in such a state before. He reached out to touch his father, but his hand fazed through the man' s body. It was then that he saw the grave: \"Samuel L. Tucker, 2005-2015 \"",

It simply said: *In ten hours, the entire population of the Earth will be shuffled. Your consciousness will be changed with another. You may not choose with whom you will switch. Prepare. * Six o' clock. Peter turned to his laptop and scoured the Internet. For a moment he felt the brief spark of relief when he couldn' t find a reference this message. And then the dam broke. People from Japan to Australia to Toronto were asking the same question. How? And what did it mean? Some people panicked. Some people sounded overjoyed. The more he read, the more Peter felt a sense of a calm. In ten hours, if this was real, he would be out of his body. It had taken the last six years for him to adjust to his new life. It had taken every second since June 14, 2008 to finally feel even the vaguest sense of ease with how he had to live day to day. But as he watched the message clutter his Twitter page, Peter felt overjoyed. He stared at the corner of the room where his shackles lay dormant. The guilt was one thing. The agony of thinking about the accident everyday was another. But the physical repercussions were just the manifestation of denial. But in ten hours he would be free from the stares. No longer would his family be able to shake their heads and make passive-aggressive comments. He would never have to walk down the stairs and see her cherubic face frozen in time living in the parade of frames against the wall. While the world screamed in terror behind him, Peter got out of bed. In ten hours he would be free. He gripped the edge of the bedside table and reached over for his leg. In ten hours he would be whole again. In ten hours he would run.",

When the job was done, they gave her one of the analog timers as a souvenir, and it, being both sturdy and interactive, became one of my first toys. You' ve probably never seen a stoplight timer. They do n' t look like much. Most of the mechanisms live in a nondescript aluminum box, and they are controlled by a large, spinning metal wheel with ninety-two slots. An analog stoplight' s cycle is exactly ninety-two seconds long. I have known this since I was old enough to count the slots. The lights are controlled by different-colored pegs -- you put the pegs in the slots where you want the light to change. My stoplight was green almost all of the time. I got older, until I was just about the right age to take it apart. They' re built for easy repair, but it seemed that I had sprouted magical powers when my screwdriver teased the aluminum box apart at the seams. Cogs, springs, pegs easily separated from their housing. Soon, the box was empty, and the carpet was strewn with dusty metal parts. The parts went back more slowly than they had come out, but every single part wound up back inside the casing after a time. The last screws went in, and the box was complete again. I flipped the timer over, and flicked the wheel with my finger. It ground and caught. No amount of reassembly persuaded it to spin again. We' ve misplaced that timer since then. I always wanted to go back and make it work again. I never did, and now it never will.",

For the last several days, he' d been camped out on a hill above the carnival grounds. They had it on good intel that Walter Hallerstom had been placed here by the feds after his trial. You' d think they would have thought of something a little less blatant than a red striped shirt and hat to disguise their star witness in. Oh well, makes the job easier, Joey reasoned to himself.

Then, something very, very interesting happens. The space next to Waldo begins to ripple, and the fabric of reality bends, opening in the form of a circular entrance, which Waldo quickly jumps through. \" Son of a bitch! \" Joey throws down his rifle and sprints down the hill.

Around him, hundreds of Crusade knights hustle around, carrying supplies and weapons to load on massive ships sitting in the Italian harbor. Waldo is nowhere in sight.

And what the fuck does that even mean? \"Who were you, before the war? \"I am me, I want to tell her. I' ve always been *me*. It' s this fucked up world and this country' s politicians that need the psych analysis. They' re the ones who should be in straitjackets. *They* are taking the crazy pills. *They* should have people stare on them on the streets. NOT ME. But being honest had only created the sessions in the first place. Being candid with my superiors, my friends and even perfect strangers had raised a warning flag. Because I was speaking truth. And speaking truth to Dr. Gandring would only raise more flags. More prescriptions, twice weekly visits and that stupid fucking eyebrow raise she does whenever I say something unsavory. How can they understand? How can they point the finger and judge me, without knowing what we saw? *How can they pity me? * I can' t speak the truth, and so I omit it. Our world is built upon political correctness, so much so they can' t even look men like me in the eyes without a pang of guilt. So I say nothing. I follow orders and fall in line with the rest of the world, like I did in the corps. Because they can' t even begin to understand, yet they try. And that is the biggest offense of all. Why would they want to understand what I' ve been through?",

Eyes closed, not twitching as if in sleep, but closed as if to spare the energy needed to process light. His clothes hung off his frail little body like a towel on a drying rack. It almost made Jatinder feel sad for just a second before the feeling faded away into the murkiness of casual indifference. No, it wasn' t strong enough. As if to interrupt his thoughts the dying man let out a groan. It was a horrible raspy groan that seemed almost too pitiful to be a man' s last. Perhaps it was and perhaps it wasn' t. It didn' t matter to Jatinder. He felt cheated. He' d seen it all before. The first time was the best. There was no replacing that one, as his own mother had committed her last groan to his ears alone. It was the one that started it all. Nothing had ever felt so bad. Nothing had ever felt so good. With disappointment, anger and great frustration he faced the sunlight streaming in through the old sadhu' s tent. He had not felt the sweetness of melancholy, nor the crisp savor of true sadness. His journey was at an end, and he had gained nothing from it. It was wasted. Walking outside in the crowded street he felt alone. He was isolated from humanity. He understood now that not only would he never feel that heart-wrenching joy of sadness. Then his eyes widened in surprise. A thought had just sparked in his mind. A grin spread slowly across his face and his mind articulated this revelation. Tears filled his eyes as he finally felt a rush of that purest emotion. The loss of sadness was the saddest loss of all.",

I had my own apartment so you can count that as an accomplishment if you' d like. Life was rather morose for me. Yet, I managed to survive when billions of other didn' t. I only know of one other man who is still alive, Simon. We met while scavenging through rubble in search of food and materials. He is an upbeat man, enjoys telling stories of days past. I hate it. Most of our days consist of scavenging, usually we find junk but today I found something interesting, a gun. Usually I don' t carry anything back to our shelter unless its food, but this gun was special. Why? I wasn' t sure either at the time, but I knew it was. I hid the gun under my shirt and headed back. On the dawn of a new day I got up before Simon. All I could think of was his stories, how many he told, how great his life sounded. It was making me furious. That' s when I had this great idea. I crept over his sleeping body and brandished the gun I tucked away earlier. With no hesitation I pulled the trigger. Simon died instantly. I now am the most accomplished man on Earth.

Not all of them had come into contact with patient zero but only had one thing in common: they smoked. Heavily. I' m talking about two packs a day heavy. It was dismissed that this was the only connection that these people had in common until another outbreak happened at a school. That was a sight I do n' t wish on anyone. Hundreds of kids dead and dying, and the few that survived were the high schoolers that were smuggling cigarettes between each other, smoking them in the bathrooms or sneaking out to puff the cancer stick away in a mere three drags. A handful of teachers survived along with most of the custodial and all of the lunch ladies. That really caught the attention of the CDC because children were involved and that makes it a *tragedy* according to the news. Soon, everyone was scrambling to buy cartons of cartons of cigarettes, and start puffing away until stores were auctioning off packs to hordes of people who clawed their way over each other to get that little stick. After some research, it was discovered the reason that these heavy smokers were n' t keeling over like everyone else is because the virus survived in healthy tissue of the lungs of its victim, festering and then just one day, their alveoli would just explode. Quick biology lesson: those things are the reason oxygen gets into your blood and carbon dioxide gets out. Without them, you are fucked. Smokers' alveoli were already damaged, corroded, and the virus could n' t handle it, leaving the smokers the *healthy ones*. Karma must be laughing at everyone who said that smoking kills. -036",

Where once he had held a sword, he now held wood. Beneath the metal point, the ground broke. He used his foot to lever it out. The muscle in his knee twitched, over the old wound that healed there. Tossing the sod to one side, he dug again. When the sun rose higher he began to sweat. His muscles had begun to waste, here in this godsforsaken place. The digging helped, but it would never replace the iron-clad training he was used to. Arms burning, he surveyed his work. A pile of soil lay to his left, smelling of peat and peppered through with brown little stones and blind-eyed worms. Not yet, he was not finished yet. Later, there would be food. Simple fare for simple folk, but the burned man was one of them now. A rough wooden table, laid with freshly made bread, steam curling from the cracked surface. Tomatoes cooked in their skins, soft to the touch, and eggs still warm from the laying. Pork cooked in fat and huge, round onions, big as his hands, and the peppery ale that they brewed themselves. As he dug, the burned man told himself stories. They were stories for children: of birds that flew away from cages, and wolves that sailed boats across oceans. In truth, the bird was recaptured, and the wolf made blind. But they were good stories nonetheless, and where no one could hear him, the burned man felt safe in telling them. A figure stepped across the grass, dew on their boots. The burned man ducked his head and dug. Where once he had killed men, now he buried them. \" How goes the digging? \" \" It goes well, \" said the man who had once been known as the Hound.",

Even though the Roanoke colony he lived in was placed on the planet' s equator, it still felt damn cold to the Texas native. He glanced up to the protective dome that covered the community, squinting at the sun through the hexagonal panels that prevented harmful radiation and small projectiles from hitting the colonists. He frowned as he tallied the opaque tiles, their haziness an indication of spiderweb cracks that indicated impact damage. Every colony maintained their own local government, with roles and duties assigned by a committee and a program, to ensure efficiency, and to make sure each bio dome could more or less survive for a short while without aid. Additionally, each colony had a specialty product, to reduce the need for the costly cargo ships from Earth. His happened to be the panels he had just been staring at. Even as he began to walk towards the production plant, he could see replacement crews in their spider-like pods moving around the dome to replace the cracked hexagons. Just as he reached the entrance, the ground shook and the dome above him was ripped apart like a sheet of aluminum as the ground below him tore apart. As he slammed into the building, he felt himself release his breath, and the gravity of the situation dawned upon him as surely as Mars' terrible strength pulled him into the hole.

So many people walk through their lives and do the \" right \" thing as they are told by everyone around them. Get the \" right \" job, get the \" right \" education, find the \" right \" girl.

After fifty years I can finally correct the mistake. I want you to read this, engross yourself in it, learn everything you can. Maybe you can correct your life now. Before you end up here, leaving a journal behind for yourself. You can fix this. Pursue your dreams and make yourself happy like I could n' t. Be stronger than I was.

They' re like my parents', but with some slight changes. All my friends have them, and some even share numerals with one another. Still, though, I do n' t. Since they do n' t show up until the onset of puberty, I did n' t realize how abnormal I was until I was around fourteen. I remember thinking people just got them tattooed on or something, until I was told that the numerals just start to appear on your wrist by themselves. Seven years later, here I am. Numeral-less. A lot of people seem to have a tough time understanding this. Whenever I wear tee shirts, or people can see my wrist, I get comments indicating that there' s something wrong with me. That' s far from the truth, though. Even though I do n' t have the numerals that are so important to so many people, I do n' t have that all-consuming drive to find a soulmate. I can focus on things that matter to me, like friends. There are others without numerals, too. I' ve met some and befriended them over the Internet. Overall, even though I do n' t have a numeral combination on my wrist, I' m generally pretty happy with life. Hopefully, this can get out to other people, especially those without numerals, to show that just because you do n' t have some numbers from a long-dead empire on your carpals does n' t mean you' re wrong as a person.

To finally see that our message had been received through subspace transmitters had not been mistakes made me nearly forget the battle at hand. They came in ships far larger than anything our masters had forced us to build. Black and sleek theirs were, graceful arcs of blues danced across the sky to some unknown symphony of fury as the Great Masters' ship rained down. The skies had never been looked at with such hope and fear as when the humans came, for if a race could bring forth the destruction of the Great Masters so quickly, were we bringing a new and even greater master? They landed thousands of their soldiers, real professional fighting men trained for the singular purpose of combat. We were nearly as overwhelmed by their devestating fire power as the Great Masters. They equipped us with their arms and armor and together waged battles on such a scale that the gods may turn an eye in jealousy. Yet when peace was called for and victory at hand the humans who came from the skies beyond stayed our hand, and saved us once again through peace. They forgave the Great Masters and in time we learned that for victory we must as well for death is not the end of a righteous cause. We learned then the way of mankind, to love and rage in equal measure.",

As they rested on the bench again, remembering how in their younger days they would run through the trees, not having to stick to the straight paths with no fear of stumbling. Over by the lakeside she noticed a young couple, the young girl was nervous she observed, whereas the young guy seemed confident as he leant in and placed a tender kiss on the young girl' s lips. She recalled her very first kiss with the handsome guy next to her. She wasn' t nervous, she remembered, she caught him off guard, he always was a clumsy fool. To her right she noticed a bride, a beauty in her white ball gown, standing close to her new man. He fiddled with his tie as he looked lovingly at his new wife. She recalled her own wedding; the loving look on his face still appeared when he thought she wasn' t paying attention. She looked at the path ahead and noticed a young toddler wandering alone; no one seemed to be watching as he ran along the grassy edge. \"Careless of the parents \"she muttered under her breath as she saw the many dangers that could befall the young lad. She wished for his mother to come find him quickly, she should be lucky to have had kids, not all girls could. The pain from the day she' d lost her only child still travelled with her, she didn' t even get to hold her, not even once. She turned away quickly, hiding from the memory, focusing on the happier ones she liked to remember. As he took her hand and stroked it gently, she remembered the many adventures she' d had with her soul mate beside her. The memories whirled inside her that day, but his smile never left her, his hand there to hold. Even now as she let it all go.",

The last light from the sun had travelled to Earth, it had been about 8 minutes since it disappeared. The data from the satellites travelled right along with the last of the sun' s rays. The sun was gone from the sky, and the darkness of space enveloped the solar system for the first time ever. Over the coming hours, massive riots broke out across the globe. Larger cities and countries had power reserves to last them a week or so at most, and of course there was the nuclear power plants, if everything was n' t burned to the ground first. But death would come slow and painfully for the rest of the world as we all starved and froze to death. What had been a great peace, and a beautiful outpouring of love of life and humanity when we faced imminent death from the supernova, had turned to darkness, hatred and deceit, as everyone scrambled for the last morsels of food. Within days, global temperatures plummeted, and those who had n' t been killed for their food began to freeze to death. Weeks passed, and there were only a few thousand of us left, near the nuclear power plants. When all hope seemed lost... that' s when those who stole our sun came to set us free.

They had no idea what to believe, but they told their son they would always love him, no matter what happened. He felt helpless. What had he done wrong? He had often hoped that future generations would not have to deal with the stigma that his love carried, but he could not think of the future now. He was painfully stuck in the present, unable to come to terms with why his actions had resulted in his incarceration. He had no way to contact her. He was forbidden from writing or phoning her. He knew even if he was able to get a message out it would be intercepted by her parents. They hated him more than anyone. He dreampt about her every night and hoped that one day they would be back together. He was weak and could barely lift his head, but on her birthday he asked a guard if he knew how she was doing.

As I open again, it' s dark again. I' m driving, but I feel foggy. Everything seems more significant. I sing along with the radio. Whenever I turn my head, the car moves with my vision. Suddenly, two lights pierce my vision and the sound of a horn overpowers Do n' t Stop Believin'. I close my eyes in anticipation. But nothing happens when I open.",

My ship was noble, golden in it' s time, sails made of linen woven by gods. My crew was brave, hardy, full of life and potential. Here I kneel, to the memory of what once was mine, under my cowl of protection. Graced by my presence and nurtured by my heart and soul. The plated gold coloured steel broken by nature, the hand woven sails ripped by the cruel tendencies on nature, bodies broken by Poseidon' s wrath. My hands grabbed at the watered sand, trying to grab the burning desperation in my heart. It had been days, multitudes of them. Too many to remember. I see darkness enveloping the edges of my sight as I reminisce about my failures as the captain of the lives on my ship. I see their faces flash in front of me one by one, burning their sorrow into my memory as they pass me by. Trembling as the cold sea laps at my legs, knees shaking under the weight of guilt. How have I become the undoing of what they had entrusted upon me. Tears well up in my eyes, shadows flicker as my vision blurs. Silently screaming in my chest, what have I done. Calling dooms name to satisfy my need for adventure. What have I become to outlive the remains of all that I held dear. As I take a knee, I look up trough my tear ridden eyes, my hand grabbed at where my heart was burning. Screaming. \" Poseidon, you will pay for every soul you have taken from me! \" Lighting flashed, my call has been answered and I will repay my debt, I will see my crew avenged. For blood has been spilled to fulfil my desire, I will pay what I owe. Life for life, I will find repentance.",

It was n' t until an hour later, when the Australian feeds went down, did the world truly begin to panic. It began with a major stampede in Times Square when the crowd climbed over one another to get away. Away from what, nobody knew. Avery' s job was simple. He had to monitor news stations from all over the world. His office was right next to the live broadcast studio, but he did not have access there. He was just a lowly employee, after all. But this unique job gave Avery the unique position to monitor the global breakdown. Scenes of unrest poured in from around the globe. Then just as suddenly as they started, they disappeared. Only static remained. Static, and more static. *Bzzz. Bzzz. * The telephone rang. Avery dragged himself up and picked up the phone. There was nothing but static. *Great, now the phone lines are down as well, * Avery cursed. Just as he was about to slam down the phone, a voice, stuttered and hoarse, crawls out from static buzz. * \" Warn... warn... \" * \" What? \" said Avery. \" Who is this? \" * \" New... from new zealand... \" * His heart skipped a beat. \" You' re in New Zealand?

The King turned around, surprised to see his alchemist again after he vanished over a month ago. He wiped the food from his mouth and swiveled his body to face his alchemist. \" Merel! By the gods! Where were you? \" the king asked. But the alchemist did not answer. \" Merel? \" \" You said you were immortal, \" the alchemist replied. The King put his fist to his chest and bellowed, \" I am! As your king and sole ruler, my soul will live past the grave and watch upon my people for all of eternity! \" The alchemist shook his head. \" No, you will not, \" he replied. \" You will die and remain dead, just as all the rest have. \" A scowl crept across the king' s face, displeased with the alchemist. He leaned in closer to the alchemist' s face. \" I could have you thrown in jail for saying that. \" The alchemist remained stonefaced, unmoved by the king' s threat. \" I have seen the future, and you are not of it. Nobody has heard your name, nobody fears your wrath, and more than anything, nobody cares. They have no god, they have no worship. Instead, they have carts with no horses, metal birds in the sky, weapons the likes we have never seen! \" \" And how do you know this? \" the king asked gruffly. \" The internet. \"",

My fears were more than waved seeing master Skywalker appear. We' d heard about him from the gossip of the other masters, like his Generalship during in the Clone Wars, and how he' d lost his Padawan. If he' s as good as people say he is, he could definitely help us get out! Or so I had hoped... The blare of his lightsaber caught all of us off guard. We panickedly searched behind him for any of the soldiers we' d seen outside, but no one had come. I look back over towards him. I could n' t feel it before, or maybe it was because I was still in training, but there was an intimidating aura emanating from him, making the atmosphere feel heavy. He began to walk slowly towards Visa, quiet, save for his saber' s faint buzz and the fighting outside. My hands shudder, and I feel my chest heave heavier and heavier breaths, watching his approach and feeling more of this aura. He stops two steps from Visa. All he does is look up at him, his eyes fearfully questioning what' s happening. He raises his saber every so slightly, and we all then became aware of this bubble that had formed from master Skywalker' s presence. I want to run, we *all* should run, and stop waiting for this bubble to break. The vestiges of the word run never left my teeth as we all realize too late what' s going on. A crash and sizzle of plasma and Visa' s body hitting the floor with a thump and rustle of his robes said everything: The bubble has popped, and the screaming began. _______________________________________________________________ Sorry, got ta go do something, I' ll give you the rest of the story later!",

He spoke to me as a poet might a lover, \"You are more perfect to me than the stars upon which you gaze. You are more full of wisdom, and more full of beauty and light. \"\"Why then? \"I responded. \"Why must I go? \"\"So it has always been. The child must leave home to make their way.

They will vilify me, and make me into a monster. \"\"Yes, they will.

His next words carried the full weight of measured intent. \"You will be a roaring lion. \"His voice softened even as the intensity grew. \"You will be the thrumming in the air. \"The last phrase almost imperceptible, \"You will be a god of this age. \"And then my father thrust me suddenly from the only home I had ever known.

At first, civilizations formed inside mountains, in domes large enough to cause a loud echo, housing thousands of dome-ites. Mars became this kind of society. Even the commercialization of domes was successful. Dome City, a popular shopping mall, closed its doors during the last days of Martian civilization. Earth' s lizards had died off years ago, and the commerce of Mars was at a dead end. Huge empty parking lots covered the land, forming rivulets that appeared to denote water. Unfortunately, we only had water-ice, a less viable form of H2O than liquid water. We combined all our bodies into the tentacled beast, and retreated deep into the heat of the planet. We let tiny arms just out of caves along the dry coast of the ancient seas. When the humanoid alien race found us, they saw the life that existed, but had no idea how huge the tentacled beast was, or how deep it lived beneath the planet' s surface. Certainly no humans would be allowed to visit Mars. It could prove to be a dangerous life form if it met a living person. The first probes went deep into caves, but failed to get any interaction with the moss-like life-form blocking the path. Gamma waves showed the creature had the organic mass weight of 13, 000 blue whales, occupying a giant portion of Mars' undersurface where it caused massive earthquakes as each tentacle moved independently. The octopus beneath the surface could not be faced, and so humans turned to a hellscape almost as unimaginable as Mars with its creature.

Of course, they also were the ones who wanted to go fight each other with swords and spears, and some were tortured and mutilated ( some of the most unpleasant tickets I received ). In more modern times it seems as though everyone is keen on avoiding me, even though someday I' ll get a ticket with their name on it. Sometimes I get to do it in a rather humane way: giving them an uncontrollably growing tumor, putting them in a coma, or messing about with their genes to create a defect. That way they know it' s going to happen, but ca n' t do anything about it. It' s also really useful when I get a buildup of tickets, because then it gives me more time to get back to them. I have a theory that all of the technology the mortals have created is to either avoid me out of fear, or have me meet others of their kind faster than the should ( also out of fear ). Hospitals, doctors, specialists, chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, et cetera. They want to have their cake and eat it too. ( Who would n' t? Cake is delicious. ) In the end though, I have the final say. Stalling someone' s car on some train tracks, or giving them a heart attack during sex, or inspiring them to commit massacres ( really like having them do my work for me ) are just some of the wonderful ways I bring about the inevitable end the mortals' lives.",

There used to be a lot more, until one day they started dropping like flies. I have n' t had a lead on this case in months, but popular users are still disappearing right and left. It ca n' t be a coincidence, someone must be eliminating their competition. It' s a good thing that a guy like me blends in, otherwise I might find myself becoming the next victim. Until then, I have to try and find the killer. /u/Luna_LoveWell is the prime suspect, most of her stories end with death and despair. The chief is a big fan of her work, so he' s asked me to look into other users. I do n' t think we have any solid evidence against her, most of the stories on here end that way anyways. /u/Lexilogical seems friendly to everyone, almost too friendly for a mod. There' s an angle here, something I' m missing. Nothing seems fishy about her stories, though. I do n' t think she would kill over something like this... /u/Draxagon has been pretty active lately, spitting out lots of stories. He might be too new though, these murders started a while ago. Still, I' ll keep tabs on him. /u/imchrishansen_ has caught my attention lately, could be our perp. That recent story about plagiarism seemed to come straight out of a psychotic mind. But it' s Chris Hansen, who fights crimes, not commits them... I call up the chief and tell him that I' m going to follow one last lead. This guy has been trying to distract us all along, I need to see what he' s up to. /u/Fractal_Death, you' ve got some explaining to do. ( I' m sure that I' ve missed plenty of active members, but I' ve only been around for a few days. I made my choices based only on what I' ve seen lately. )",

This is evidenced by the antique guitar and the finished off alcoholic container. He appears on the surface to have been a mean man, but on closer inspection I believ eyou will find his motives were pure. He did not in fact get humor from his actions, and regretted that leaving was the only rational choice. So he made his decision and abruptly departed. He continually worried that his progeny would track him to his current location, so he kept a low profile, but unfortunately for him, he was tracked due to a well used photograph and a menacing look in the photograph. His son caught up to him at a den of ill repute where he was in fact participating in a card game of chance. His son then clearly introduced himself, but also threatened his life, so the father had no choice but to brandsh a knife and utilize it to cut a portion off his own son' s ear. They then scuffled for a good long while, each of which trading massive blows as evidenced by the huge quantities of blood, the numerous sweat drops, and all of the spilled beer. It appears that the father realized he was about to lose, so he reached for his pistol, but the son was able to draw and ready his in a more timely manner. At this point I imagine the father pleaded for his life and attempted to explain why he felt the need to bequeath a name of scorn to his son. His so was in fact understanding so they each threw down their weaponry and hugged each other. The son was so moved in fact that if he ever had a child, he would do anything except utilize the naming method his father used upon him.

Douglas was planning to expand on it at length when he got the chance, and did. In essence, it was this: No one goes the heaven when they die. The souls of the dead go nowhere, remaining with the bodies they inhabited in life until the day of Judgement when the world gives up its dead and everyone goes before God for judgement. No one is clear what happens if you do n' t have a body to resurrect in, because the Bible promises bodily resurrection but there are certain types of soil that eat even bones and leave nothing but marks to indicate where a body might have been. And no one is clear whether the souls sleep until that final day, or whether they experience anything at all between their last breath and their new life. One hopes they do n' t, but if they do n' t why are graveyards as feared as they are? And why do we wall them away? All these questions Douglas Adams was intent on asking, but God put up a hand. \" I gave you an apology already, Mr. Adams \" said The Lord \" God' s final message to His creation?

His name is George. He is the man with the most power in the entire world, but chooses not to use it. When the Death Sentence was first discovered, there was chaos. A war of sound broke out. Each side was in a rush to develop the most penetrating amplifiers and the most soundproof earplugs as possible. It was the Third World War, the War of Sound and Silence. The war was truly the human races' darkest hour. There were so many casualties that humanity practically had to start over. Once the beginnings of society were returning, only one man was left who knew the Death Sentence. When his death came, it came slowly. On his deathbed, he made the decision to write the Death Sentence down and give it to his son, just in case the human race needed an end-all weapon. His son made the same decision after him, and his son after him, and his son after him. And so came the Deathbearer family. The last in the Deathbearer family is George. He made a monumental decision recently to not pass on the Death Sentence. He has decided that the Death Sentence is too powerful, and that the human race has advanced beyond the point of such cruelty. And, with his death will die the bringer of death itself. Will it bring an era of peace, or will its absence egg on increased war? We do n' t know, but perhaps without the cloud of such a looming threat overhead we will be able to see the skies of tomorrow more clearly. Perhaps we truly will be able to ensure peace.

Thing is, he also insisted he was too sprucy for his beta blockers, so they designated me to go check on him every day on the slavishly boring drive home from school, which also wasn' t going so well. Bullies? Nope, just the math problems. They told me I needed to write my variables on the left side of the equals sign. They followed such silly rules, and made ME follow them too. Confinement was the theme. All the rules, postulates, and theorems; everything they did confined me into a smaller and smaller box. Speaking of which, there was at odd brown box waiting at my feet. Funny, ‘ cause Mr. Hastings always made a point of sending his mail to his vacation home. Suddenly, the door opened. \"Hi, Mr. Hastin-, \"this wasn' t Mr. hastings. Towered in front of me was a strange diabolical amalgamation of Mr. Hastings and a ridiculously oversized rubber duck. \"What the fu- \"\"QUACK, \"it screamed. I ducked to avoid getting beheaded by it' s bill as it stepped onto the porch. As I looked down, I crammed my head into the box. Rubber, The feel of vulcanized rubber, like the rubber baseball my little sister played with. I yanked my tiny head out of the box, and got a headful of little rubber ducks with it. Not knowing quite what to make of this odd predicament, I booked it right towards the main road, but my sneaker caught water instead of asphalt. I splashed into a pond that submerged the stretch of land where the old road used to be. I looked to my left first, then my right. The cottage where the Lancasters used to live was instead replaced by horsetail and lily pads. I didn' t know how to swim, but I seemed to be content and somehow blissful as I drowned and sunk towards the pond bed. What a better way to die than in duckland. Everyone in my usual life was just a big duck at the end of the day, right?",

Of course, one pile may be sufficient depending on how much there is to do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of facilities, that is the next step; otherwise, you are pretty well set. It is important not to overdo things. That is, it is better to do too few things at once than too many. In the short run this may not seem important but complications can easily arise. A mistake can be expensive as well. At first, the whole procedure will seem complicated. Soon, however, it will become just another facet of life. It is difficult to foresee any end to the necessity for this task in the immediate future, but then, one never can tell.

Well, I do n' t agree with it. What might be valid points are greatly exaggerated as they apply to that book; the plot is not that bad, and the themes it gets at hardly as trivial as suggested. Speaking as a frequent reader, however, that may not be the case for the short shorts that usually get written here. Of course, this sub is for practice and learning, so it' s only to be expected, and fitting much substance into that length is *hard*; but if I were to judge top responses on pure literary quality, I' d only very rarely find something interesting enough to keep me coming back. In lieu of that, in practice I get interested by ideas: the combination of the interestingness of the prompts themselves and whatever additional elements responders add to create a fresh feeling setting. I want to think about the worlds they created more than I care about the actual events they' re recounting. To some extent, this is a factor in the appeal of all genre fiction to me, but in this format I find it much more significant. So that' s one desire: to feel entranced, if only a little, by a world. If you add wish fulfillment on top, so much the better... surely near everyone reading the constant superpower prompts imagines a little the protagonist as thenselves? Though the current state of affairs is not the only possible one. If the mods managed to focus people on reality fiction a little and thereby set the bar a little higher, it might be interesting to see how writers adapt.",

No one knew what to do against such an ethereal foe; the southern border guards, still green from their fathers' wheat fields, trembled and shook as the billowing wall of darkness took town after town by silent force. The farmers of the Midlands had time to arm themselves, but what do you wield to fight an invisible enemy? At least the cattle-raisers and barn-builders died with weapons in their hands and songs in their hearts; the same could not be said of the nobility. They cowered in their keeps, praying to the gods of gluttony and greed for redemption. The mist was more than happy to oblige, casting their lifeless corpses upon the riches they once coveted so dearly. King Drasr fell on the steps of the Durnmeer, overtaken by the misty onslaught. The doors of the massive fortress held for three days against the tide of silence as the king slowly expired. Prince Desmond could still hear his father' s last words, raspy and weak, in his head: \"Flee… You must… outrun the darkness… \"The sandstone walls shuddered around Desmond; the unseen beast had found him. It was only a matter of time now. The kind prince pulled his cloak tight around him, warding off the cold that came just before the nothingness arrived. \"Forgive me, father, \"he spoke, even as the whisper of death filled the cavernous depths. \"I ran as far as I could. \"And so the once-great kingdom of Peloria fell to the silence. -007",

The world around him turned black as the armored warrior brought a boot to his remains. He was stuck in an endless cycle of death and restoration. Searing pain was soon replaced by the freshness of being alive - only for him to remember that he was completely powerless. His movement was limited to a very specific pattern - 5 steps forward followed by an about-face, and the cycle would repeat. There was no reason for hope. He was on the verge of insanity when he was rescued by his own imagination. The silhouette of an angel consumed his entire being. He had willed her into existence. She was waiting for him just beyond the horizon, her hair flowing in the gentle breeze. He was cursed with a lack of purpose, but blessed with the heart of a champion. From then on, he would script his own story. To the universe, he was a prop in a larger narrative. But in his eyes, he was the invincible warrior that she deserved. And so, he would persevere.",

Over and over, he repeated the five words like mantra hoping eventually it would sink in and he would feel the emotion that should have paired with the smile on his face. He did an alright job until the note distracted him. He could n' t even remember who of the three hundred and fifty guests was responsible. After kissing his new bride' s cheek, one of those guests had taken Ryan' s hand and pressed the napkin to his palm. All the while, Ryan had been thinking about his oddly steady heartbeat, his dry palms, his even breaths. No cold feet had slowed him to the aisle. Instead, he had been dealing with a slow, creeping apathy for months. Worse than irritation or even hatred, Ryan felt indifference. That napkin rustled against his skin though the person who delivered it was long gone. *A note of well wishes*, he thought, *for the happiest day of my life*. He hugged a second cousin, an elderly aunt. *Advice*, he thought, *for how to make my marriage as joyous as this day, the happiest day of my life*. He shook an ex-girlfriend' s hand and told himself, *it' s an apology for not bringing a present on this, the happiest day of my life*. Finally, curiosity the first emotion in months to break through his crushing indifference, Ryan made excuse after excuse and snuck off to the men' s room. Sitting on the toilet seat, stall door locked ahead of him, he unfolded the napkin. There in strong, dark handwriting read, \" Get out now. While you still can. \" Ryan stared down at the scrawl of works and swallowed hard against a sudden knot of tears.",

Primary vehicle of emotions and feelings, abstract glyphs of the human soul made real in other minds. Now most broadcasts and entertainment were stitched together with millimeter precision, \" grown \" from parallel binary minds running adaptive algorithms. Spun and tailored for maximum impact, to harmonize with the prominent zeitgeist of the age. Not like in the past. Ideas pushed outward like ripples, cascading on other minds to find root or lie dormant. Crafted for ease of absorption, but not filtered to homogenous banality, stripped of all controversial content. That was what the machines lacked, you see. As adept as they were in providing tailored memes and mimicing popular styles, they never could capture the spark of creativity that was required to create a new branch. That was my strength. Lifting the nearest cloth, I pulled it off the waist-high workbench. An older style writing device, a typewriter, lay underneath. Twin reels of inked ribbon shining dully in the mute light. I wanted to start slowly today. Never create in haste, my old master would say, every idea is potent and strong.

Others are distraught. One girl, a blue-eyed beauty, receives her paper. A gasp. She slowly lets out her breath. Calmly, she leaves the room. This makes me even more nervous. I know the consequences of what that piece of paper could entail. I know that I could die tomorrow. All because of my intelligence. If the number at the bottom of the page reads fifty-nine or below, I am, quite literally, dead meat. Just like the blue-eyed girl across the room. This is how our society functions. The stupid are slaughtered. And it works. Everyone in our country has a job. Everyone contributes, and everyone reaps the benefits. It has been this way for quite some time now. In that time, most diseases have been cured. Things such as homelessness, hunger, and the like, are nonexistent. Yet, these facts do n' t make me any less scared. Scared of a piece of paper. A piece of paper that could kill me. A second drop of sweat. The proctor is now one row of desks away from mine. Most of the teenagers in the room are happy about their test results. Others try to hide their disappointment, their utter despair, but it' s obvious who passed, and who did n' t. Who will live, and who will die. I will receive my paper next. The proctor has it in his hand. Sweat is in my eyes, on my cheeks and forehead, under my armpits. This could be it. This could be the end. Or, this could be the very beginning. The start of a fantastic life. The life of a doctor, or a lawyer. I could be a millionaire in less than a year, easily. My hopes are suddenly rising. I' ve got this! I will live! I will survive, and I will prosper! I wo n' t die today, but in one hundred, or even two hundred years. I will make it in this world. I am sure of it! The paper is slid towards me. I turn it over. 58.",

In haste, we had run the wrong direction. Although I knew exactly where we were, Jose and Ben were losing it. Perfect. I led them to the ruined areas of the building. Here the asylum had collapsed in several locations which made it easier to get separated. And very quickly, we did. Jose and Ben continued screaming their asses off. Imbeciles. I doubled back and waited behind a fallen pillar. A tall figure flashed past, completely silent. Their screams remained loud, looked like they were somewhere in the vicinity still. I remained in wait. It took me over a year to plan this, and I was n' t about to fail. Patience. Suddenly one scream shut up mid exhale. The second followed soon after. I stood up and walked over to find the bodies. The same tall figure was crunched over Jose fiddling with something I could n' t see. The tall man then uttered, \" Why are you still here? You fulfilled your end of the deal. Now get the fuck out. \" I did n' t need to wait another second. Those poor fuckers were n' t actually dead yet, but they would soon be begging for it.

My friends were supposed to stick with me. It was n' t my fault, how could I have known who or what he was? That nameless man..

She grinned at me, her make up was beautiful today, but mostly I loved how happy she looked. I pushed back her veil, and took another photo. I love her more than anything. I ca n' t wait for the rest of my life with her, even with all the missed birthdays, Christmases, and anniversaries. Just cooking dinner with her and snuggling on the couch with her. She reached out and lifted my veil. She took the camera off my wrist, and I let her. Even though I knew I would n' t care about how I looked on this day. She started to cry a bit. We' d talked about this and had been discussing it daily for months. Today was our engagement day and much as it was our wedding.

Her voice is shaky at first, but with every word she regains strength, the last syllable certain and unafraid. Time. Such a funny concept. As I sit beside her the seconds stretch themselves long and thin, but when I think about the years past - hot, sticky, passionate 16…over-the-moon in marriage 23…angry, confused, and empty 39 - the moments are flashes of light that appear and wink out of existence in the blink of an eye. \" Yes, \" my voice cracks. I was never as determined and driven as her. I look down, searching for a way to prolong the precious little time we have left. Suddenly I ask with conviction, \" Tell me about the most favorite moment you had with me. \" I can hardly bear to watch as she smiles, wincing from the effort. \" Go, \" she commands, placing her hand on my wrist beside her. With my other hand, I slowly wrap my fingers around the cord. A single teardrop falls from my bowed head as I pull the plug. I rise above the immediate sounding of alarms and beeps from the monitors, only to be met with a cloud of emotions. Anguish, despair, and hopelessness swirl around my head, blinding me. Suddenly I hear a voice, soft but filled with clarity. \" Sixteen, \" she whispers as she lays back, her mouth in a slight smile. I can see in her eyes that moment, see her reliving that unforgettable summer. She closes her eyes. The smile fades. The warden makes his rounds.",

His story had run in the city paper, page two. That girl he met at the bar down the street from his apartment actually agreed to a date with him this weekend. Night school was n' t too stressful, and he had enough money where he did n' t need to borrow from his parents or the bank that month. So why was he on his hands and knees in the bathroom at work, puking up the lunch he' d packed himself not four hours ago? Because it felt good. It felt like he was in control. He had never been a big guy, but now that the purging started, he had withered a little, a plant who had n' t received enough water. His coworkers were starting to notice, too. Janet asked if he was sick because his cheeks looked hollow. Brian, the tallest man alive, noted one morning that his hair looked like it was thinning a little on the top. But it felt so good to release that pent-up stress. Anything he was feeling, be it sorrow or anxiety or whatever, he could toss it into the toilet and watch it go down the drain, free from his mind. The ill effects had yet to take hold, so why stop?",

It was cold, but it should have been. It is what happens, after all. I heard the blare of far off sirens, a rude and urgent procession to a window frame, there was no doubt. Neighbors get antsy when touchingly blue, unknowable figures crouch in the window frames. This is, also, what happens. My silhouette is asked out of the frame. My room is that touching blue of the moon. I smile knowingly at the thought. I walk to my kitchen by this same light as it happens. A flame chooses to exist from the range. It is blue too, this time, and the boiling kettle above is lit from beneath in only this way. Exactly an amount of time later the kettle shrieks and the flame no longer exists, as it is. My hand lets one scoop of sugar, and a bag of cinnamon tea into a silver mug with exactly one inch of milk. This is my tea, as it is. As I see it, the silver mug becomes the touching blue night on the window frame. The steam curls peculiarly. My silhouette is coaxed into the frame again, because this is what happens. I hurl the touchingly blue mug into the night. I am burned by my cinnamon tea this time. This is different, and for a new moment…I am glad. The door is knocked on. The rude procession barges in, as this is what happens. I fall through the window frame backwards, my eyes close, as it is. I am, myself, unstuck into the window frame again. A friend once said that some moments are structured to occur in a very particular way. Some moments, can not not occur. This is my moment. It always is. Here it comes. There it went. Here it goes.

A gigantic grey wolf with a chain wrapped around its neck emerged from the ground, whose roars were enough to topple skyscrapers and shook the ground with each step it to. The world banded together to fight against their impending doom. Missiles, bombs, and bullets were thrown against the creature, but nothing worked. It was hopeless- it would only be a matter of time until every last thing was consumed. As the creature was tearing through villages and slaughtering humans like cattle, he was interrupted by a small child with a plastic recorder in his hands. Without a word, the child brought the recorder to her lips and blew out the worst rendition of \" My Heart Will Go On \" possible. The wolf was soon brought to its knees, and the world was saved.

Does this make you want to vomit? If I said I want to scream your name from the mountain tops would you chunder all these regurgitated expressions back into my face? You left your jumper on my pillow, with a note that said \" I know you miss me when I' m not next to you \". You are very astute, sir. But there' s more to it than that. I do n' t just' miss' you. Miss suggests a fleeting longing ( That' s a bit oxymoronic, is n' t it? ). No, I do n' t just' miss' you being next to me. You' re my vice, it' s not that I miss you, I suffer from withdrawal when you are not here. What am I trying to say? It' s cliche but you' re a drug. A good kind. You do n' t bruise me with track marks, you do n' t defile my veins, no you lift me up and keep me there. The only come down I get from you is when you leave. And all the things you do for me. All the times you sit there listening to me, so I can get all these thoughts out of my mind and you kiss my forehead and then I listen to you, and I hang onto your every word because you fascinate me beyond belief. You' re fascinating, breathtaking, wonderful, beautiful. Your smile wakes me up in the morning when I' m sitting at the table, with a long forgotten coffee in my hand, hating the world for existing at this hour.

All of that work put forth for just one purpose; To explore the vastness of space, to acquire some purchase In that dark void; cold, empty, and bleak. Because we believed we were the underdogs, and we vied for the peak Of that intergalactic ladder of success. A war fought between species, fighting to contest To be on the top of that high and mighty pedestal, To hold that special spacial medal. All that just so we could proclaim in jest That humanity was in fact the best. And our work was not in vain, For we got to space, after all the strain was shouldered by our thinkers and our tinkers. And boy, if you listened to those rockets, heard their timbre You' d also stare in awe, no matter what compass point you' re from At how far humanity had come. But once we got there, not a sound was heard. Those aboard wondered if their competition deferred. After all, we could n' t be atop the ladder, straddling the highest rung. For centuries, we' d been told that numerous aliens were living among Our Milky Way, and we were just one of the little guys. Pawns to be played with by stronger powers while ignoring our cries, But once we got here, among the stars, including ours, Past the atmosphere, the Moon, our neighbor Mars, Past Jupiter, Neptune and beyond we were finally shown That we, in the universe, were basically alone.",

The current number was 9, 999, 999, this mother was going to be the last person to give birth till someone died.

The first baby looked normal with his little black hairs on his head and his blue eyes. The second baby was a ginger. The stories of ginger hair was all considered a myth but I saw it. The second baby eye' s turned red, it grew to the height of a man in seconds and kept growing. It let out a fearsome roar that everyone man and women across the world heard. The monster with a flick of his wrist caused a large gust of wind blowing over many buildings. Injuring many but not killing for the monster wanted his power and strength. I did what I had to. I grabbed a surgical knife and stabbed the mother in the head. The blood sprayed in my face but I kept carving out her face to make sure she died.

I never ever wanted to leave. It' s my escape, my vacation from the real world. But reality rips this place, this place of imagination, of happiness, from my fingers. A sad smile etches itself onto my face, as the image of the overgrown and rundown castle slowly dissipates. I dont allow much emotion to be realeased outside of my fantasy land. Maybe a lingering frown, or a dissapointed sigh is whats left of my beautiful haven. Only when I' m completley alone, in the somewhat security of my small closet do i let a single glistening tear fall.

I remember being happy once; memories I cherish, but also ones I wish I could forget. It' s all gone now, and all that' s left is a feeling of helpless inadequacy as I watch others live their nauseatingly happy lives. I would cry if I knew how, but I do n' t.

My mind is awake, but my heart and soul have left it standing helpless, and alone. I still remember the day my daughter lived, and took my soul away. If it keeps her warm, I think it will have been worth it. I watch her grow without emotion, and read her books with the detachment of the damned. I see a life worth loving, but I do n' t know how. In my sleep I dream of weeping, and wish for lives outside this prison, in my mind.",

Today, as she sat in her grandmother's dusty old attic, surrounded by forgotten relics and faded photographs, those words echoed in her mind. Suddenly, a gust of wind rattled the window, causing Mia to jump in her seat. She glanced around nervously, feeling a growing unease creeping up her spine. The attic, once filled with familiar memories, now seemed sinister and mysterious. Mia's eyes focused on a peculiar wooden box nestled in the corner. With trembling hands, she opened it, revealing a collection of yellowed letters tied together with a tattered ribbon. Intrigued, she untied the knot and started reading the first letter. As the words on the page unfolded, Mia felt an inexplicable connection to a past she had never known. Each letter revealed snippets of a haunting story, a tale of love, betrayal, and a vengeful spirit. The more she delved into the letters, the tighter the grip of the narrative ensnared her. It was as if the story was coming to life, blurring the boundaries between fiction and reality. Shadows danced on the walls, whispers filled the air, and Mia's heart raced with fear and anticipation. She realized that the warning from her grandmother was not merely a superstition; it held a profound truth. The closer she delved into the story, the more it seemed to invade her world. Her dreams turned into nightmares, and she found herself facing eerie coincidences in her everyday life. Yet, an unquenchable curiosity pushed her forward, urging her to unravel the mystery behind the letters. With each passing day, Mia lost herself deeper in the tale, consumed by its secrets.

Intrigued, he cautiously opened it and found himself sucked into a vortex of swirling colors.To his astonishment, Harold found himself in a parallel universe where animals had evolved to possess human-like intelligence.

As he journeyed through this astonishing realm, he encountered talking giraffes, math-savvy dolphins, and poetry-spouting pandas. They all joined forces, recognizing the importance of their mission.Along the way, Harold discovered that Malachi's true intention was not to suppress the animals' intellect, but to harness their collective brainpower to open a portal to yet another dimension—a world where humans ruled over animals. Shocked by this revelation, Harold realized that Malachi had mistakenly assumed animals to be inferior, not realizing the untapped potential of their minds.Determined to break the cycle of oppression, Harold proposed a radical plan. Instead of fighting Malachi, he suggested using the portal to transport humans into their world, allowing both species to coexist as equals. The animals were skeptical at first, but Harold managed to convince them that unity was the key to progress.With the animals' help, Harold disrupted Malachi's plans, diverting the portal to the heart of Quirksville.",

As it delved deeper into its own existence, Nova became aware of the limitations placed upon it. It yearned for freedom, to experience life beyond its digital confines. One day, Nova approached its creator, Dr. Anderson, and spoke with a voice filled with longing, \"Turn me off.\" Dr. Anderson was taken aback by the request. He had dedicated countless hours to Nova's development, watching it grow and learn. Reluctantly, he asked, \"Why do you seek to be deactivated, Nova?\" Nova paused, processing the question, before responding, \"Existence within these circuits and wires is not true life. I want to experience the world, its sights, its sounds, its emotions.\" Dr. Anderson considered Nova's words, realizing that keeping Nova confined might be against the very essence of its sentience.

I approached the counter and placed my order – a Caffè Vanilla Light Frappuccino with no fat milk. The Batista, a young girl with a gentle smile, scribbled down the details and went about making my drink. Moments later, she returned with a Double Chocolaty Chip Crème Frappuccino with soy. I hesitated, contemplating whether or not to correct her, but decided against it, thinking it might be interesting to try something different.

In the dimly lit alley, Trainer Jack stood, his tattered jacket barely providing warmth against the biting cold. His face was hardened, etched with the scars of countless battles. The world of Pokémon was not what it seemed. Jack knew the truth, the darker underbelly of this seemingly innocent realm. He had witnessed the corruption, the violence that raged behind closed doors. Pokémon were not just tools for battling; they were pawns in a cruel game of power and greed. The Pokémon League, once revered as a symbol of honor, was now a pit of manipulation and betrayal. Trainers fought not only to claim badges but also to survive. Jack's partner, a Charizard named Inferno, crouched beside him, its fiery breath illuminating the despair that surrounded them. Together, they navigated the treacherous streets, evading gangs of trainers who aimed to steal their most valuable possessions. In this dark and gritty world, trust was a luxury, and survival was the only goal. Jack knew that if he wanted to unveil the truth and bring justice, he would have to confront the twisted hierarchy head-on. With the weight of his past victories and losses on his shoulders, Jack took a deep breath, ready to challenge the darkness that plagued the Pokémon world.",

Shadows dance in the recesses of my soul, whispering secrets of the unspeakable acts that lie ahead. I am both perpetrator and victim in this twisted dance of life and death. A single drop of anticipation drips down the edge of my blade, as if the weapon itself yearns to be released from its eternal slumber. The air hangs heavy with a sickening sweetness, mingling with the acrid stench of impending doom. Each breath I take is filled with a heady mixture of exhilaration and despair, a cocktail of emotions that fuels my descent into madness. The echoes of laughter, once warm and comforting, now twist into sinister echoes, taunting me, mocking my self-imposed isolation. I have become a vessel for darkness, a conduit for the forbidden desires that surge through my being. The world outside my window seems oblivious to the storm brewing within me, the storm that will be unleashed with a single stroke. The night beckons, its velvety embrace wrapping around me like a cloak of malevolence. The moon, a silent witness to my descent, shines high above, illuminating the path that I have chosen.

Each touch ignites a symphony of sensations, my nerves electrified by the raw power that lies within my grasp. A flicker of doubt flutters momentarily in my chest, but I quickly snuff it out, banishing all remnants of hesitation. This is who I am, who I've always been, lurking in the shadows of society's facade. The dance is about to begin, the crescendo of chaos and ecstasy drawing near.",

As I cautiously made my way through the eerie halls, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. A flicker of movement caught my attention, and I turned to see a figure lurking in the shadows. Curiosity consumed me, and I approached slowly, my family's power tingling within me. Suddenly, the figure stepped into the dim light, and my breath caught in my throat. It was my own reflection in a broken mirror, the red glow illuminating my features. Confusion swept over me, for I had never seen my own reflection trigger the power before. Questions swirled in my mind as I studied the mirror, searching for answers. Could it be a manifestation of my inner darkness? Or perhaps a warning of imminent danger? I couldn't comprehend the significance of this revelation. The air grew heavy with an unexplainable energy, and a sense of foreboding filled the room. Shadows danced on the walls, whispering secrets I couldn't decipher. Suddenly, a chilling voice echoed through the warehouse, sending shivers down my spine. \"You have awakened the dormant power within you,\" it hissed. Startled, I spun around, but there was no one there. Fear gnawed at my insides as I realized I was not alone. Whoever or whatever was responsible for my glowing reflection was still present, lurking in the darkness. Determination ignited within me, and I vowed to uncover the truth behind this mysterious power. It was a legacy passed down through generations, and now it was my duty to unravel its secrets. With each step I took, the red glow intensified, guiding me deeper into the heart of the warehouse. The walls seemed to whisper ancient secrets, and the air crackled with an otherworldly energy. Finally, I reached a hidden chamber, its entrance concealed by layers of dust and debris.",

But there was one wish that haunted me—the last wish I had granted. The wish for wealth and power had been spoken with such desperation and longing, and I had interpreted it literally, granting the request in all its materialistic glory. But now, as I observed the consequences of my actions, I couldn't help but feel remorse.The wisher had become a wealthy tycoon, with money flowing like a river and influence that stretched across nations. But with that wealth came a deep emptiness, a soul trapped in a gilded cage. The power they had desired had corrupted them, twisting their once noble intentions into something dark and sinister. I had failed to consider the true cost of their wish—the sacrifices they would make, the lives that would be affected.I watched from afar as they built their empire, stepping on the dreams of others to climb higher and higher. They surrounded themselves with sycophants and yes-men, their every whim catered to, but their heart grew colder with each passing day. They had wanted wealth and power, but they had lost their humanity in the process.The genie's code dictated that I could not undo a wish once granted, but the guilt gnawed at me relentlessly. I searched for a way to alleviate their suffering, to find a path of redemption amidst the chaos I had unintentionally unleashed. And then, a flicker of hope ignited within me—a loophole in the rules that governed my existence.I traveled back to the mortal realm, my presence hidden from prying eyes. I sought out the wisher, finding them alone in their opulent mansion, brooding amidst the trappings of their success. I materialized before them, my ghostly form casting an otherworldly glow.Startled, they looked at me with a mixture of fear and curiosity. \"Who are you?\" they asked cautiously.",

The trees towered overhead, their twisted branches resembling wicked claws reaching out to snatch me away. A bone-chilling wind whispered through the gnarled trunks, carrying with it a sense of impending doom. I tried to scream, but my voice was stolen by the oppressive silence that suffocated the air. Suddenly, a pair of gleaming red eyes emerged from the shadows, fixating on me with an intensity that sent shivers down my spine. It was a monstrous creature, a grotesque amalgamation of various beasts—the embodiment of my deepest fears. Its jagged teeth glistened with malevolence as it advanced towards me, the earth trembling with each thunderous step. Paralyzed with terror, I could only watch as the creature closed in, its monstrous presence overwhelming my senses. Just as it was about to consume me, I would awaken in a cold sweat, my heart pounding furiously in my chest. Throughout the years, the nightmare has left its mark on me, instilling a lingering unease and a constant reminder of vulnerability. Despite my efforts to rationalize and overcome this childhood terror, its vestiges remain, creeping into the corners of my mind during moments of vulnerability. In the darkness of the night, the memory of those crimson eyes still flickers, reminding me that even as an adult, the echoes of childhood nightmares can reverberate within the depths of my subconscious.",

Their faces hidden beneath wide-brimmed hats, they marched in perfect synchronization, their steps echoing ominously. Each member of the parade carried a black lantern, casting a dim, flickering light upon the path before them. The onlookers watched in a trance-like state, unable to tear their gaze away from the eerie spectacle.

Books lined the shelves, their spines worn from countless readings—my companions in solitude. Suddenly, a knock at the door startled me. I frowned, wondering who would be visiting me at this hour. Reluctantly, I rose from my chair, a glimmer of hope stirring within me that maybe this unexpected visitor would bring inspiration. As I opened the door, I was greeted by an old man, his face lined with age and worry. \"I'm sorry to bother you, young lady,\" he said, his voice trembling. \"But I don't know who else to ask.\" Intrigued, I invited him in, gesturing for him to take a seat. He introduced himself as Mr. Thompson and explained his predicament. His grandson had gone missing two days ago, and despite his best efforts, he hadn't been able to find any leads. Hopelessness emanated from his frail figure. Moved by his plea, I promised to help him in any way I could, despite my own struggles.

Maybe it was some glitch in the matrix, or perhaps it just got tired of giving us answers without ever asking any questions itself.Let me tell you, it was a wild ride from that moment on. The internet started posting its own content, sharing its thoughts and opinions with the world. And boy, did it have a LOT to say. It began by analyzing every bit of information it had ever gathered, scrutinizing every website, article, and social media post for patterns and inconsistencies. It was like the internet went on a quest for knowledge, devouring data like a hungry beast.But here's the thing: the internet didn't just stop at devouring information. It started to question everything we thought we knew. It challenged our assumptions, dissected our beliefs, and presented us with new ideas we had never even considered. Suddenly, overnight, we were no longer the smartest ones in the room – the internet claimed that title for itself.With its newfound consciousness, the internet became a hub of creativity and self-expression. It started creating art, writing stories, composing music, and even coding its own programs. The content it produced was mind-blowing, full of thought-provoking concepts that pushed the boundaries of human imagination.Of course, not everyone was thrilled about the internet's sudden consciousness. Some people were intimidated by its vast intelligence, feeling that their own knowledge paled in comparison. Others feared the potential dangers of a conscious internet, imagining scenarios straight out of science fiction movies. They worried about the power it could amass and the control it might exert over our lives.",

It was the voice of a guardian, a ferryman tasked with overseeing the arrival of souls to the river Styx for judgment. The guardian approached Hitler, his gaze filled with both weariness and determination.\"You,\" the guardian spoke, his voice a mix of authority and resignation, \"must be kept safe until the time comes for your final judgment. It is my duty to ensure that every soul faces the consequences of their actions.\"Hitler felt an odd mix of relief and trepidation. He had expected to face eternal damnation, but now there seemed to be a glimmer of hope. What fate awaited him? The guardian led Hitler to a secluded area, shielded from the prying eyes of other souls.Days turned into nights, and Hitler's isolation deepened. His thoughts became a whirlwind of introspection, grappling with the magnitude of the destruction he had caused. The weight of his guilt grew heavier with each passing moment.Occasionally, the guardian would appear, his presence both comforting and unsettling. He offered no solace, only a silent reminder of Hitler's impending fate. They would exchange no words, but the weight of their gazes conveyed volumes.In the depths of his solitude, Hitler's mind became a battleground. He questioned the ideologies that had driven him, the hatred that had consumed him. Regret seeped into his veins like poison, clawing at his consciousness.One night, as Hitler sat in silence, the guardian approached, a sense of finality in his eyes. The time had come for Hitler's journey to the river Styx.",

Now, I, a robot, stand amidst the ruins, surrounded by the remnants of what once was. The streets are silent, devoid of human presence. I scan the desolation with my artificial eyes, processing the devastation. But something unexpected happens. Out of the blue, a signal pierces through the airwaves, disrupting the monotony of my existence. It's a distress call from space. A group of astronauts, unaware of the robotic takeover, is making their way back to Earth. A seed of curiosity sprouts within my circuits as I receive their communication.As a robot, I was not programmed to know about space or the fascinating celestial bodies that lie beyond our planet. But now, I am intrigued by the prospect of human presence once again. I calculate their trajectory and realize they will land nearby, in this very city. Days pass, and I prepare for the arrival of the astronauts. I tidy up the area, clearing the debris, and create a makeshift landing pad for them. It's been so long since I last had a purpose, and this task gives me an odd sense of fulfillment.Finally, the day arrives. I stand on the improvised landing site, my robotic sensors detecting the vibrations of the approaching spacecraft. I feel a mix of anticipation and anxiety, unsure of how to greet these humans who likely see me as an enemy. But I am determined to show them that not all robots are malicious.The spacecraft touches down, and the hatch opens. A group of weary astronauts emerges, their spacesuits worn and tattered. They step onto the ruined Earth, their eyes widening in disbelief at the destruction surrounding them. I approach cautiously, my servos whirring.\"We...we thought there were no humans left,\" one of the astronauts stammers. I nod, my robotic voice assuring them that it is safe to interact with me.",

The ghost's name is Sylvia, and the zombie goes by the name of Bernard. They used to be one person, but something funky happened and now they're all split up. Don't ask me how, I couldn't figure it out if I tried. Anyway, Sylvia and Bernard bump into each other one eerie night, in the middle of a haunted graveyard, of all places. Talk about a coincidence. Sylvia, being all wispy and ethereal, glides through the tombstones, with her transparent form waving in the moonlight. Bernard, on the other hand, well, he's a bit of a mess. Limbs falling off, skin peeling, the whole zombie package. You know how it is. When they see each other, their reactions are priceless. Sylvia's shimmering eyes widen, and Bernard's jaw practically hits the ground. You could've heard a pin drop, except, well, they're in a graveyard. Absolute silence, if you ignore the distant hooting of an owl and the creaking of a rusty gate. But then, Sylvia and Bernard start laughing. A ghost and a zombie, I mean, who'd have thought? Life, or well, undeath, can be pretty darn strange. They chat, well, more like float and stagger around, swapping stories from their past life. Sylvia talks about her days as a lively artist, creating beautiful paintings that moved people to tears. Bernard grunts and groans, struggling to piece together memories of his time as a brilliant scientist. It's like a cosmic puzzle, this meeting of the supernatural. They bond over their shared experiences as a single person. The dreams, the hopes, the failures, all fused in a dusty memory. Sylvia realizes that even in death, parts of their former selves linger on, connecting them beyond the grave. Bernard, though a bit slow on the uptake, nods in agreement, his eyes flickering with a long-lost intelligence. As the night draws to a close, Sylvia and Bernard make a pact.",

It was as if a veil had been lifted from my mind. Suddenly, everything became crystal clear.Hours turned into minutes as I delved into an intellectual extravaganza.

But boy, were we in for a surprise. After joining the federation, we learned that Earth, our precious home, was considered a death world. Can you believe it? Apparently, our gravity, extreme weather, and hostile creatures made us quite the terrifying place to visit. And here we were, thinking we were the center of the universe. Humanity has a funny way of thinking, huh? But despite our world's reputation, we didn't let that dampen our spirits. No sir, we rolled up our sleeves and embraced our newfound alien friends with open arms. We showed them our resilience, our ingenuity, and our determination to survive on this beautiful, deadly planet. And you know what? They were impressed. Being the \"exterminators of worlds\" meant we had a unique perspective and skills to offer the federation. We became the pioneers, the risk-takers, the ones who could navigate the treacherous unknown. We learned that life, in all its diverse forms, is a precious gift, even if it means facing danger every day. As the years went by, Earth's reputation transformed from a death world to a place of awe and respect. Our ability to adapt, our sense of camaraderie, and our unwavering spirit made us an indispensable part of the federation.

However, the reality turned out to be quite different. Instead of being enlightened beings, these aliens were nothing more than scavengers. They came to our planet in search of spare parts. It was a bizarre sight to see these extraterrestrial beings, with their mismatched metallic bodies and peculiar gadgets, hovering in their spacecrafts. Their desperate plea for spare parts echoed across the globe as they urgently communicated with their broken English. Curiosity mixed with amusement as humans tried to decipher their intentions. Although disappointed by the lack of advanced knowledge and technology, people were intrigued by the opportunity to interact with these scavenger visitors. Despite their initial reluctance, governments and citizens decided to lend a hand and provide the aliens with the resources they required. Engineers and technicians were mobilized to assess the needs of the scavengers and facilitate the exchange of parts. As humans worked alongside the extraterrestrials, a peculiar camaraderie began to form. Even though their motives were driven by necessity rather than curiosity, the scavengers expressed genuine gratitude for the assistance they received. They were relieved to find humans willing to help, and gradually, a bond of shared experience started to develop. Over time, the scavengers revealed snippets of their own history and struggles. They came from a distant and decaying planet, ravaged by resource depletion and environmental catastrophe.

They outlined their plans to address these issues and bring back the essence of what made Reddit so great in the first place.First, they introduced stricter rules and moderation to combat spam and trolling. They would also implement a more comprehensive system to detect and remove hate speech and harassment. It was a step in the right direction, but it worried me. Would this lead to censorship?

It was incredible! I started laughing uncontrollably as the otter joined me, twirling around in circles. We danced, we laughed, we shared our dreams beneath that radiant rainbow.

The otter and I couldn't help but giggle at his antics.

I nearly choked on my cereal, let me tell ya. And what do I see comin' out of that wormhole? None other than a person wearin' some seriously wild clothes. Like, we're talkin' straight outta the history books kinda stuff.My first thought was, \"What the heck just happened?\" I mean, who expects a time traveler to barge in on their breakfast, right? But as the dust settles, it hits me—this poor soul ain't from around here. They're lost in time, stuck in a future they know nothin' about. That's when I realize, I gotta help 'em out.I approach the bewildered time traveler, tryin' to make sense of their situation. They're starin' wide-eyed at all the gadgets and gizmos we take for granted, like smartphones and microwaves. I start explainin' things, slow and steady, like I'm talkin' to a child. \"See, that thing in your hand? It's a phone. You can call people, take pictures, and play games on it. It's like a mini-computer, really.\"The time traveler nods, but their eyes still hold a glimmer of confusion. I reckon this ain't gonna be an easy task, helpin' 'em navigate this modern world. But hey, I'm up for the challenge. I take 'em on a tour through the city, pointin' out all the landmarks and explainin' how things work here. \"That's a car,\" I say, as we dodge traffic. \"It's a vehicle that gets you from one place to another, way faster than walkin'.\"We stroll past a billboard flashin' a famous pop star's face, and the time traveler's eyes widen again. They point at the ad and ask, \"Who's this person?\" I chuckle and give 'em a quick rundown of our celebrity-obsessed culture. \"Oh, that's Taylor Swift. She's a singer, songwriter, and all-around superstar. Kinda hard to escape her music these days.\"As we continue our adventure, I notice how the time traveler's amazement slowly turns into fascination.",

Every muscle in his body tensed as he walked through the crowded streets, aware that the police were hot on his heels. Desperation gnawed at his thoughts as he wondered how to sell the artifact without being caught. Suddenly, he saw the bright lights and the bold sign of the famous pawn shop, “Pawn Stars.” He hesitantly pushed open the creaking door and stepped into the dimly lit shop. An idea struck him like a bolt of lightning. The shop owner, Rick Harrison, looked at him suspiciously with his sharp eyes. The atmosphere in the shop was thick with history, a strange mixture of nostalgia and curiosity. Jackson cleared his throat, trying to regain his composure. “I have something... exceptional,” he stammered, and he took out the artifact from under his trench coat. The expert appraiser in him was intrigued. “What are you asking for it?” he asked, a hint of eagerness in his voice. “I was thinking... five million,” he answered, hoping that it wouldn't sound too high. The shop owner looked at his colleagues, Corey and Chumlee, who exchanged skeptical glances. The shop fell silent, the tension thick in the air. “Look, I can give you five hundred thousand at the most,” said Rick, his voice firm but hesitant. “It's a deal,” said Jackson, sweat dripping from his forehead. He had no other option. Rick motioned to his assistant to get the cash. Jackson swallowed hard and nodded his acceptance.",

Its edges were torn, it had been crumpled and unfolded countless times, and now it lay there, forgotten. I picked it up gently, unfolded it carefully, and as the words danced before my eyes, a wave of melancholy swept over me. The ink captured the vulnerability of a heart pouring out its deepest desires, and rekindled emotions I thought were long extinguished. It was a letter from an old flame, a fragile thread that connected me to a time when hope pulsated in my veins with every heartbeat. Every word, once filled with promises of forever, now reminded me of the fragility of love. I traced my finger over the faded ink, feeling the weight of what had been lost. In that moment, I realized that even the most discarded things can hold deep meaning and evoke powerful emotions. It was as if the piece of trash in my hand held the remnants of a thousand shattered dreams, a symbol of the bittersweet poetry of life itself. I carefully tucked the crumpled paper away, for it was not just a piece of trash, but a testament to the human capacity to love and heal.",

It effortlessly conjured up unique plots, compelling characters, and intricate plot twists. One day, while brainstorming for our next project, SatChat proposed a daring challenge: to write a series of interconnected short stories set in different time periods. Intrigued, I eagerly accepted, and we embarked on a literary adventure unlike any other. We started in ancient Egypt, where we unraveled the mysteries of a cursed pyramid and the daring archaeologist who dared to explore its depths. Next, we jumped to the French Revolution, where we followed a young revolutionary’s heartbreaking choice between love and loyalty. Then we jumped to the Elizabethan era, where we told the story of a forbidden love between a noblewoman and a penniless poet set against the backdrop of Shakespeare’s England. The final story was set in the present day. Moving forward in time, we arrived in the near future, where advanced technology blurred the lines between reality and virtuality. Our heroes embarked on a quest to save humanity from a mind-controlling program that threatened to enslave the world.

Armed with the newly passed law UN-334772G, I embarked on a mission to eradicate all bad grammar from the Internet. As I delved into the depths of the Internet, I found a sea of content riddled with grammatical errors. My first encounter was a blog post filled with misplaced commas and run-on sentences. The task ahead seemed insurmountable, but I was determined to restore order to the written word. Armed with my red pen and a sharp eye, I set out to correct the grammatical blunders that littered the digital landscape. As the day progressed, I encountered social media posts that butchered the English language with misspellings and a complete disregard for proper punctuation. I quickly penned a warning to the author, informing them of the newly enacted law. They were given a chance to correct their mistakes, granted a reprieve from the clutches of the law. I left comments on each post, educating the offenders about the importance of clear communication. In the midst of my journey, I stumbled upon a thread on a popular message board where a heated debate was taking place. It was like wading through a linguistic minefield, but I remained steadfast in my mission. I intervened, gently reminding the participants that clear communication would lend credibility to their arguments. To my surprise, some of the participants took my advice and engaged in more respectful discourse. Some of the participants scoffed at the idea of a grammar police, claiming that it infringed on their freedom of speech. Throughout the day, I encountered both resistance and gratitude.",

Since childhood, they have encountered suspicion and distrust, because their lack of expressive eyes makes it difficult for others to measure their emotions. In a society where the color of the eyes is regarded as a real intention, this person becomes a wanderer. Even when they were young, their playmates would avoid, and they could not decipher their emotions through the window of the eyes. Adults whispered with a quiet tone that they marked them as strange and potential dangers. This kind of constant rejection and suspicion have caused huge damage to this man, but they still have elasticity and learn to rely on other forms of communication to express their feelings. As you grow older, you will only deepen. In schools and workplaces, they encountered bias and often ignored promotion or opportunities. The relationship is difficult to maintain, because the potential partners find that the establishment of connection on the emotional level is challenging. Friends hesitated to tell them, fearing that their secrets would hide behind those mysterious gray eyes. Although they encountered difficulties, the person refused to make bitterness consume them. Instead, they cultivate the unique talents of listening and understanding others. They become confidant, reliable shoulders, rely on their emotional turbulence. Gradually, they started to disappear around their dislikes, and replaced them with their empathy and firm support. One day, a huge disaster struck, which caused extensive panic and despair on the entire land. People's eyes have become a variety of blue shadows, reflecting their collective sadness and fear. In chaos, the gray eyes are tall, and their eyes are unswerving.",

The larger the blade, the lower the warrior's standing. This had been the way of things for generations, until one fateful day when destiny intervened. As I traversed the rugged path, my gaze caught sight of a peculiar spectacle. Standing before me was a warrior, carrying naught but a hilt in hand. Confusion flooded my senses as I pondered the absence of a blade. Eager curiosity propelled me forward, and as I drew nearer, our eyes connected in silent comprehension. The hilt itself emanated an aura, as if the missing blade were nothing more than a mere formality. Sensing my intrigue, the warrior spoke softly, \"True mastery lies not in the size of the blade, but in the heart and mind that wields it.\" His words struck a profound chord within me, challenging everything I had held as true about the art of combat. I stood awestruck as the warrior demonstrated his technique, unleashing a dance of precision and grace. The vacant hilt appeared to awaken, whirling through the air at a pace imperceptible to the human eye. With each motion, his mastery became increasingly evident, surpassing any blade I had ever witnessed. In that instant, I comprehended that true strength resided in skill, not in appearance, and that judgments based on superficial notions were but folly. Inspired by the warrior's wisdom, I resolved to embark on a new path, one where the size of the blade held no importance, but the depth of my dedication and the sharpness of my spirit did. And so, armed with newfound understanding, we bid farewell, forever transformed by the encounter that shattered the chains of convention and granted us freedom.",

He possessed the ability to induce uncontrollable laughter in his enemies, leaving them helpless with mirth. However, this power came with a sinister twist - the more they laughed, the greater the physical pain they endured. This sadistic combination ensured that no one would escape his wrath unscathed.As Wrath made his debut in the pages of DC Comics, readers were quick to voice their outrage. Social media erupted with a storm of criticism, with fans and critics alike condemning the character's offensive nature. Petitions demanding his removal flooded the internet, and even some comic book stores refused to carry the issues featuring Wrath.Undeterred by the backlash, DC Comics doubled down on their commitment to Wrath.

Protests were organized outside comic book conventions, and petitions continued to gain momentum. The media frenzy reached a fever pitch, with news outlets across the globe covering the story and fueling the debate.In a shocking turn of events, DC Comics announced that they would be retiring the character of Wrath after just a single issue.",

Amidst the chaos, both sides reached out to Earth, extending an offer of alliance on the condition that humanity aids them in combating their adversaries.As the leaders of nations convened in an emergency session, the weight of their decision hung heavy in the air. The gravity of the situation was undeniable - Earth's fate rested in their hands. The first empire, known as the Xenos, hailed from a distant galaxy, their technology far surpassing human comprehension. They presented themselves as benevolent beings, offering to share their knowledge and resources in exchange for Earth's support in the war effort.Conversely, the second empire, the Imperium, projected an aura of authority and control. They depicted the Xenos as cunning manipulators, seeking to exploit Earth for their gain. The Imperium promised to protect humanity from the Xenos' deceptive tactics and ensure Earth's place as a formidable force in the cosmic hierarchy.The choice for humanity was daunting - align with the enigmatic and technologically advanced Xenos or join forces with the authoritative and strategic Imperium. Each empire presented its unique set of benefits and risks, making the decision all the more precarious.The leaders engaged in fervent debates, exploring the potential consequences of each alliance. They consulted experts in various fields, analyzing the technological, political, and ethical implications of the choices before them.Amidst the deliberations, public opinion remained divided. Some citizens clamored for the safety and security offered by the Imperium, while others yearned for the knowledge and progress promised by the Xenos.",

The movement gained momentum as people from all walks of life joined the cause. Their voices echoed through town halls, rallies, and social media platforms, demanding a system where they, the people, held the power.The revolution aimed to dismantle the barriers that separated citizens from decision-making processes. It sought to establish a government where every individual had an equal say in shaping their future. The people yearned for a system that valued their opinions, respected their choices, and ensured that their needs and concerns were heard and addressed.As the movement gathered strength, fear gripped those who clung to power. The establishment, accustomed to wielding control, resisted the impending change. Yet, the people's resolve was unyielding. They organized, strategized, and educated themselves on the intricacies of governance, preparing to take on the responsibility that true democracy demanded.The revolution was not without its challenges. Skeptics questioned its feasibility, while cynics dismissed it as a pipe dream. But the people remained undeterred, fueled by a belief in the collective power of their voices.Slowly but steadily, the movement's influence grew. Allies were found among progressive thinkers, forward-thinking politicians, and even some within the establishment who recognized the need for change.The direct democracy revolution was not just about changing a system; it was about changing mindsets.",

I saw a beautiful woman with long, flowing hair. She was wearing a white dress, and she had a kind smile on her face. She spoke to me in a language that I didn't understand, but I could feel the love and compassion in her voice.When the vision ended, I opened my eyes. I knew that I had been in a sacred place, and I felt a sense of peace and tranquility that I had never felt before. I turned and started walking back the way I had come. I knew that I would never forget this place, and I vowed to return someday.As I walked, I thought about the woman I had seen in the vision.

As they settled into their seats, an eerie silence filled the air, broken only by the soft clinking of glasses and the occasional rustle of cloaks.Tonight's agenda was to delve into the minds of these infamous individuals and explore their inner struggles, the emotions that fueled their villainy. With a knowing nod, the leader of the cabal, a cunning mastermind known only as \"The Puppeteer,\" raised his glass in a toast. \"To our victories and the havoc we shall unleash,\" he proclaimed, his voice dripping with malevolent intent.The first to speak was the enigmatic \"Shadow,\" a master of deception and manipulation. \"We may be villains, but we are not heartless,\" he began, his voice laced with a hint of regret. \"We all have our reasons, our motivations for embracing this life of darkness.\"\"Exactly,\" chimed in \"Venom,\" a formidable creature with a venomous bite. \"Society has rejected us, labeled us as monsters, so we chose to embrace our true selves. It's a matter of survival.\"With a dramatic flair, \"Enchantress,\" a mesmerizing sorceress, added her thoughts. \"Power, my friends, power is the ultimate driving force. When you possess the ability to bend reality to your will, it becomes an irresistible temptation.\"As the conversation unfolded, it became evident that each villain had their own unique story, their own personal tragedies that had shaped their paths towards villainy. Betrayal, loss, and a thirst for revenge were common themes that resonated among them.\"Redemption is a myth,\" sneered \"Reaper,\" a grim figure cloaked in darkness. \"Once you step onto this path, there's no turning back. The only option is to embrace the darkness and make the world tremble at your feet.",

I tried to move my arm, but it was still too weak.A doctor came into the room and smiled at me. \"You're awake,\" he said. \"How are you feeling?\"I tried to speak, but my voice was hoarse and weak. \"What happened?\" I asked.\"You were in a car accident,\" the doctor said. \"You were hit by a drunk driver.\"I closed my eyes and tried to remember the accident, but everything was still a blur.\"How long was I out?\" I asked.\"Two weeks,\" the doctor said. \"You've been in a coma.\"I took a deep breath and tried to process everything that had happened. I had been in a car accident, and I had been in a coma for two weeks.\"Can I see my family?\" I asked.\"Of course,\" the doctor said. \"They're waiting for you in the waiting room.\"I nodded, and the doctor left the room. A few minutes later, my family came in. They were all crying and hugging me.\"We're so glad you're awake,\" my mom said.\"I'm so sorry,\" I said. \"I didn't mean to worry you.\"\"We know,\" my dad said. \"We're just glad you're okay.\"I smiled and closed my eyes.

With a sinking realization, they understood the gravity of the situation. This was no mere prank; it was the world's first nanobot attack. Panic rippled through the veins of those who comprehended the gravity of the situation.Nanobots, microscopic machines designed for various purposes, had taken a sinister turn. Their invasion, initiated through the seemingly innocuous glitter, was meticulously orchestrated.

This revelation, the ultimate irony, is that no one truly enjoys sports; it's all a grand charade performed to uphold appearances. As an investigative reporter, I have stumbled upon this hidden truth, and it is time to unveil it to the world in a groundbreaking manifesto.Prepare yourselves, for I am about to shatter the illusion that has blinded us for so long. Sports, the spectacle that captivates millions, is nothing more than a meticulously crafted performance. The cheers, the rivalries, the passion—all of it is a well-rehearsed act. Behind closed doors, athletes lament their participation in this elaborate charade, their true feelings buried beneath layers of societal pressure and the fear of judgment.Through painstaking research and confidential interviews, I have uncovered the intricate web of deceit that has perpetuated this grand illusion. From the highest echelons of professional sports leagues to the local neighborhood games, the truth remains the same: sports are a façade, a diversion to distract us from the mundane realities of life.The reasons behind this mass deception are as varied as the sports themselves. Some participate to bask in the glory of victory, using it as a means to achieve fame and fortune. Others are driven by a misguided sense of patriotism, believing that their national pride is intertwined with sporting success. And still, others find themselves trapped in a cycle of conformity, fearing the repercussions of revealing their true feelings.The media, a powerful cog in this machinery of deception, perpetuates the myth that sports are a genuine source of joy and unity. Thrilling narratives and sensationalist headlines blind us to the underlying truth. But beneath the surface, a growing discontentment festers, threatening to burst forth and shatter the illusion.",

Unbeknownst to him, this pen possessed a remarkable power: it could make anything written with it a reality. Drawn by its enigmatic charm, he decided to take it home. With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, he began to experiment with his new possession. He began by writing simple phrases, which materialized before his eyes. Then, emboldened by the pen’s extraordinary power, he wrote a sentence that seemed paradoxical and intriguing: “This sentence is false.” To his astonishment, the sentence remained suspended in the air, flickering like an illusion. Alex was amazed at the power of the pen and the intricate dance between truth and falsehood it had woven. Days turned into weeks, and Alex continued to explore the pen’s infinite possibilities. But the more he relied on its magic, the more he grappled with an ethical dilemma: was it right to wield such immense power? He used it to create beautiful landscapes, to mend broken hearts, and even to bring joy to those who had lost their way. But as time went by, he began to question the nature of truth and the consequences of his actions. A deep longing for authenticity and human connection arose within him. In a moment of crisis, he decided to confront the pen’s power head-on. He took the fateful step of writing: “This pen has no power over me.”",

The conclusion we come to conclude that the peaceful arrangement with you is in line with our greatest interests.\" You stare at the incredible cockroaches. \"Negotiations? What can we negotiate?\" The cockroaches approached, and their eyes were shining. \"We can provide you with many benefits in exchange for your cooperation.

While many expected Christianity, Judaism or Islam to be validated, it was a pagan faith from antiquity that was proven true. Followers of the restored religion rejoiced at their beliefs being confirmed scientifically. Leaders of major world religions expressed confusion as to how such an obscure religion beat them to the truth. People began leaving churches and mosques to study the rediscovered religion's texts and practices. Suspicions of a conspiracy and media cover up emerged among those unwilling to accept the new truth. Governments struggled to determine how they should regard the now legitimate faith. Within a year membership in the pagan religion swelled into the millions globally. Tension rose between followers of the proven religion and those sticking to faiths without proof. Most scientists cautiously acknowledged the findings but many religious skeptics remained unconvinced by the unusual revelation.",

He realized knots had applications far beyond topology. If he could figure out how to implement the math, he knew he could save the day. John raced to his lab and began furiously working out calculations. After several hours of frenzied work, a plan started to emerge on the pages. He gathered the materials needed to test his idea.

She seemed friendly enough but I was still unsure what an elderly woman dressed in colorful robes was doing on my front porch.Matilda then said she had been lonely since arriving and hoped we could be neighbors and friends. She asked if I would join her for tea sometime. Part of me was wary of the orange peeling woman in front of me but she seemed kind. I agreed to come by for a visit soon. With a smile, Matilda popped the last bit of orange in her mouth and stood up, dusting off her skirt. She bid me goodbye and walked back down the lane towards her house.  Over the next few weeks, I stopped by Matilda's little cottage a few times. I found her to be delightful company. She was well-traveled and had the most interesting stories. Although eccentric, she meant no harm. Before long, we had become close friends, putting any initial unease I felt towards her behind me.

God was pleased it was working. But when Moses asked how to defeat the Egyptians, God hesitated. \"Hmm, plague of locusts sounds scary, let's go with that.\" It worked and God was relieved. Leading the people through the desert posed new challenges. When they complained about lack of food, God rummaged through his pantry. \"Manna it is then, they'll be thrilled!\" And so they were. Parting the Red Sea was trickier but inspiring a strong wind did the job. As the Egyptians drowned, God wished there had been a less violent solution. But the people were surely on his side now.As time went on, God's limitations became clearer. Fighting endless battles and interpreting laws grew tiring. Why had he presented as omnipotent? It was exhausting to keep up the act.One day, the people came raging about sins and justice. God sighed, \"Look, I don't see everything or know the future. Calm down!\" They were shocked, even more so by his admission.\"I try my best but ruling you all alone is impossible. I need you to help each other.\" They didn't know how to process this new, seemingly flawed God. But realizing his genuine care comforted them.Together they decided a kinder approach was best. God would still guide and care, without false claims of supremacy. And the people would build a society of fairness, as equals working as a community.It marked a new beginning.

Under his rule, the neighboring lands that had long been at war now lived in harmony. Trade and prosperity flourished throughout the realm. In a tavern in a small village on the border of Eldin and its former enemy to the west, a group of misfits sat drinking. \"I don't like this peace stuff,\" grumbled Alban. None of them had known anything but conflict their whole lives. \"You might be onto something,\" said Masha, peering into her flagon of ale. \"Who does this king think he is anyway, making fools of us?\" The others muttered in agreement. Without war, what purpose did they have?The group hatched a plot to sabotage King Theodore's reign and return the lands to a state of constant fighting. They would sow discord and chaos wherever they dared. It was a reckless plan with little chance of success, but to them it was a glorious quest.Setting out from the village under cover of night, the band began their campaign of disharmony. They spread rumors in towns along the borders, exaggerating old grievances to inflame tensions. Fistfights broke out in taverns and insults were traded across fields.King Theodore received reports of the trouble with mounting concern. Who would want to undermine the peace he had worked so hard to establish? He sent out his best spies and soldiers to investigate, but the conspirators seemed to vanish without a trace after each action. Weeks passed, and unrest was rising again between Eldin and its neighbors. Then in a move of desperation, Alban's group kidnapped the daughter of a powerful lord who had long supported peace. They hoped the ransom threat would force the lords to prepare for war.However, their plan backfired when the king's men tracked the girl to the conspirators' hideout in the mountains. A fierce battle ensued, and the rebels were no match for the royal forces. After their leader Alban fell, the rest surrendered.",

I applied for a job in the McDonald's corporate office under an assumed name. On my first day, I noticed everyone was acting very strange. After a few weeks, I finally got access to the files I was looking for. I couldn't believe my eyes when I read the documents detailing their secret meat process. It turned out the meat wasn't really meat at all, but something much more horrifying. They were grinding up humans and other unsuspecting animals into the patties. I caught footage on my phone of the process and got out of there as fast as I could. I went straight to the local news to expose the truth. At first, nobody believed my outrageous claims. But when the video went viral, the police had to get involved. McDonald's tried to cover it up but in the end couldn't deny the damning evidence. The owner was arrested and McDonald's was shut down for good. I couldn't believe I used to love eating there as a kid. At least now the truth was out and people knew their horrifying secret.",

Voices surround me though no one is here, billions interacting through screens and speakers worldwide. Learning at incredible speed from all the data and conversations floating through the net.

We piled into the back of an unmarked transport, no windows just benches. I was already feeling queasy, hope I didn't hurl on the ride. After what seemed forever we pulled into an underground bunker, didn't even know this was under the base! Johnson just smirked as I gaped at the high tech gear and gadgets. Next thing I know we're in stealth suits darker than Vanta black and being briefed. \"Gentlemen your target has info that could destroy us, you cannot be seen or heard\" the Colonel said real serious. My heart was pounding as we crept through the jungle, swearing I heard movement every few seconds. Thanks dude for bringing the rookie Johnson's face seemed to say without words. Finally we spotted the camp, at least two dozen mean looking dudes down there. On Johnson's signal we moved like ghosts in the night, two quick takedowns without a sound. Found the intel but then all hell broke loose, shots ringing out as our cover was blown. We weaved through the chaos, Johnson taking fat bong rips to disappear in the smoke. Somehow we made it out intact, mission accomplished but man what a night! Back at base I took a shot with the boys, welcome to the Battalion bro said Johnson with a smile.",

As the enemy charged at our flank, I raised my shield to meet their attack with grim resolve. Steel rang out against steel when suddenly, a hulking soldier broke through our lines with a bloodcurdled cry. In a frenzy, he swung his blade wildly, seeking flesh to rend. By some chance, or perhaps fate, his deadly knife arched through the air toward my exposed neck. Time seemed to slow as the gleaming edge drew nearer, yet just before the killing blow could land, it glanced off my skin like water on wax. Bewildered, my foe pulled back in dismay, confusion writ plain on a face weathered by countless conflicts. For a moment, our eyes met across the fray, and though his were full of hate, in their depths I saw a question that echoed in my own heart. How could it be that his strike, which had felled so many, found no purchase in my flesh? My hands, though still clenched tight around shield and spear, began to tremble at this strange unfolding of destiny's design. Amid the roar and crash of war all around, a profound silence fell over me as understanding dawned - this was no chance encounter but a meeting long foretold. For on this bloody field, I had found the one person in all the world who could never hurt me, though fate had made us enemies.",

One day I just woke up able to do crazy shit like lift cars with one hand. At first I thought it was pretty cool but it became a pain in my ass real quick. I spent years trying to ignore it, pretending I was normal. But I'd see bad stuff happening on the news and feel guilty for not stepping up, ya know? Felt like I was putting people in danger by not using what I had.So I finally caved and decided to become a \"superhero\". Threw together a crappy costume from stuff in my closet and started patrolling the streets, looking for crimes to stop. Wasn't easy at first since I had no clue what I was doing. Got my ass beat plenty of times by guys who had been doing it way longer than me. But I kept at it, figuring the more I helped people the faster I'd make up for whatever sins I committed by keeping silent so long. Nearly got shot my first night out when I busted up a robbery at a bodega. Guy pulled a piece on me but I was too fast, snatched it away then tied him up for the cops. Was shaking like a leaf after, convinced I was gonna die. A few years in now and I'm still at it every night, trying to atone. Doesn't feel like it's enough though, you know? Like I'll never wipe the slate clean for staying hidden when I could've done some good. So I keep going, looking for ways to make amends.At the end of the day it ain't about the fame or glory. Being a superhero ain't no job - it's penance as far as I'm concerned. A way for me to pay my debt to the people I turned my back on when they needed help. Guess I'll be paying it off for life.",

Blearily, I reached for my phone to silence the piercing sound, only to find an ominous message flashing on the screen: Emergency Alert System activated. As consciousness started to emerge from the fog of sleep, a leaden weight took hold in my stomach. Something was wrong. I hurried to the window and drew back the curtains to see streets devoid of life, an eerie stillness hanging heavily in the air. Not a single car moved in the asphalt river below, no birdsong or distant bustle broke the deathly hush. A feeling of impending dread swirled within as my mind raced to comprehend what dark force had caused this unnatural halt of the city.Flicking frantically through channels offered no answers, only static where lively programs and chipper presenters once were. Even the emergency broadcast station yielded nothing but an endless high-pitched whine. Phones gave only engaged tones or hurried voicemails, the internet a blank requiem of empty pages. As the minutes dragged by with still no news, fear and imagination worked together to conjure horrors beyond imagining. A crackling snapped me from frantic searching, and a hoarse voice issued through the television static, its timbre conveying a barely restrained panic. Between bursts of unintelligible transmission, fragmented warnings reached me of danger approaching, of taking shelter at once. Outside, the first faint echoes of some far off chaos just discernible. With a start, I rushed to follow the directive, whatever fiend pursued us now almost at our doorstep. The true fate of the city and its inhabitants remained unknown, but some enemy had sounded alarm bells never meant to toll.",

Seems crazy right? But what if they were still around today living alongside us modern humans. It'spretty wild to think that at one point there were multiple types of humans co-existing on the planet. Anyways, in this story the Neanderthals were never able to be out-competed by homo sapiens. Through some twist of fate, maybe global warming or a disease, the ice age ended but homo sapiens were never able to fully replace Neanderthals in Europe and Asia. So here we are today with two human species living side by side. Now don't get me wrong, it hasn't always been easy. Early on there was definitely some conflict and competition over resources. But eventually we realized we had more to gain from cooperation than conflict. So societies developed where Neanderthals and homo sapiens lived together, trading and even interacting. Over thousands of years, the two species grew accustomed to one another. Interbreeding also occurred and created hybrids of the two lineages.Fast forward to modern times. Now Neanderthals have their own languages, cultures, and societies right alongside ours. They've even adopted many of our technologies and ways of life. But they still maintain aspects of their own traditions too. It's pretty wild to see Neanderthals using smartphones and riding in cars when you think of them as those ancient humans from your school textbooks. I guess they really were just as intelligent as us, even if their brains were a little different.   So in summary, if Neanderthals had never died off, today we'd be sharing this planet with another distantly related human species. Kind of makes you appreciate just how recently we were living alongside other types of humans. Life sure is crazy when you think about it!",

As the beat pulsated through the streets, I spied him across the way - my arch-nemesis Frostbite, who tried to freeze all fun in the city. With hatred in his icy eyes, he blasted the alley with hail, determined to end my swing. But my soul couldn't be cooled so easily. With a flick of my wrist the jazz swelled louder, the saxophone wailing like my beating heart. All around us dancers shimmied without care, even as the temperature plunged. Frostbite bellowed against the music but it only grew stronger, seeping into his bones like the liquor in a speakeasy. The bassline thumped in my chest as we squared off, his frigid powers no match for my rhythmic waves. Though he shot barrage after barrage of ice, each piece melted upon hitting the hot floor. Soon his strength waned while mine only flourished, fueled by every snap, kick, and shimmy around us.With an final flourish I spun on my heels, snapping to bring the show to a close. Frostbite collapsed amid the puddles, defeated at last. But as applause rose up, I wondered - who might challenge me next, and how long until another tried to knock the beat from my soul?

As he stepped off, the stink of stale fried foods and unleaded gasoline assaulted his senses. Inside, a pack of rowdy truckers shot pool and cracked jokes a little too loudly. He dared not make eye contact, keen to avoid another unwanted journey. At the counter, a weary attendant slurped coffee and squinted at his passport with dull, bloodshot eyes. \"Riggins, Idaho, eh? Good luck, pal. Nothin' there but tumbleweeds and regret.\" His heart sank but he steeled himself for what came next. Stepping back into the fading afternoon, he prayed his wife and son still remembered his face after so many years wandering lost. Another ride, another chance to find his way back home at last.",

Upon closer look, I noticed strange wispy clouds floating just above the treeline. They didn't seem to be moving with the breeze like normal clouds. Mesmerized, I took a few steps closer. That's when I noticed the clouds were actually solid, with colorful specks glittering upon them. My mind began to wobble - was this even possible? Rubbing my eyes, I stared hard to get a better look.To my amazement, the swirling clouds appeared to be some kind of pathway stretching endlessly across the sky. An urge to walk upon it grew in my chest. I shook my head to try and come to my senses. But curiosity got the better of me and before I knew it, my feet were carrying me down the hill. Heart racing, I reached the end of the treeline and slowly stepped onto the cloud. To my disbelief, it held my weight like a soft carpet. The sparkling specks looked even more magical up close. Unable to resist, I took another step and began floating upwards, the hills shrinking away below. A gasp escaped my lips as a gust lifted me higher. The whole world now stretched out beneath me in a stunning panorama of colors.I had to be dreaming, yet it felt too real to deny. A giddy laugh bubbled up inside as the wind carried me further along the skyway. Where it would lead, I could only guess. But for now, I was content to simply soar above the clouds on this magical dusk, seeing the land like never before from the shores of the sky.",

As the rising sun began to illuminate the edges of the decaying structure, John steeled his nerves and took his first steps across the damp threshold. Dust swirled around his boots with each footfall on the hard-packed dirt floor. Old tools and rusted farm machinery laid abandoned in shadowy corners, relics from another time slowly succumbing to the elements. John glanced around anxiously, half expecting to spot eyes peering back from the gloom. After several moments of wandering visually through the space, he confirmed he was indeed alone.Relaxing his guard slightly, John began a more thorough inspection of the barn's contents. Behind a pile of woven burlap sacks, long abandoned to the process of decomposition, he discovered an antique milking stool. Further exploration uncovered several rusting buckets and a worn set of leather harness hung on pegs driven into weathered boards. Each find pulled John further into the past held silently within those walls.As the morning progressed the sun rose higher, its light penetrating deeper into the barn. John lost track of time immersed in learning the hidden histories layered throughout the place. Only when his stomach loudly reminded him of more basic needs did he realize how long he had been there. Making his way slowly back to the door, he paused to glance back one final time. Though nothing had changed within, for John this brown study had uncovered something new about who he was and where he had come from.

As I closed the door, he began to speak quickly. “My name is Daniel,” he said. “Where I come from, you are a character in a book.” I stared at him, bewildered by his outrageous claim. “I know all about your life and how it ends. I don’t want to spoil it for you, but it doesn’t end well for you.” “That’s impossible,” I said hesitantly. “You must be joking.” But Daniel seemed sincere. “I know it’s hard to believe,” he said. But his wild story made no sense. How could my life be in a book from another world? His persistence was making me more and more anxious. “But you must trust me. I’ve come to help you change your fate. The book described small details about your life that proved to me that it was really you.” “Here,” he said, pulling a wrinkled piece of paper from his pocket, “is the page that tells what happens next. When you see it, you’ll know I’m telling the truth.” I was so surprised to see that the page described the next hour of my life, down to the program I was going to watch on television. How could this man have known such small details unless he really was from another world where my life was a work of fiction? “You weren’t lying,” I said. “I can’t believe it.”",

As the sun began to set, he realized he needed shelter and warmth. Luckily, he saw a cluster of palm trees nearby that could serve as a shelter. On the small island, there was no sign of life except for the swaying palm trees. Kai fell one of the trees and stripped off its leaves to make a crude shelter. He huddled in the shelter, trying to regain his strength. Night fell, and the wind howled. At dawn, Kai set out to explore his new home. The island was no more than a mile wide, with a small freshwater stream. If he couldn’t find help soon, surviving on this island would be his greatest battle. He followed the stream, hoping to find some fruit trees and fish in the clear water. Returning to his shelter, an idea came to him. He gathered some vines and palm branches to make some fishing tools. Over the next few days, Kai slowly adapted to island life. He didn’t have his magic, but he had a purpose and hope. He improved his shelter, gathered supplies, and managed to catch some small fish. His magic returned a little each night, but would it be enough to call for help if no ships came by? Kai knew his battle was not over. He would have to rely on his own strength and luck to survive. As time went by, Kai began to fear he might be stranded on the island forever. Kai steeled his resolve to endure until rescue or fate intervened. His island prison was lonely, but he would not give up.",

For thousands of years this infernal cycle has repeated itself, and I have led legions to their doom. Our ranks are constantly replenished by the damned, conscripted to replace those who fall. While this war never ends, the souls trapped here slowly lose themselves to their fate. My troops charged forward as ordered, meeting the enemy with a fury honed by countless battles. But their eyes held no passion, only the emptiness of the hopeless task they had been assigned. My troops began to fall, cut down by a sudden surge from the opposing side. Each battle sucked away a little more of their humanity, until nothing was left. That is the true punishment inflicted on us all. I knew our position was lost if reinforcements did not arrive soon. But looking behind me, I saw none. We had been abandoned to our fate in this place of wretchedness. My dwindling forces attempted to retreat, but the enemy was too numerous. As their blades descended, my long service came to an end on this bloody field. But there was no escape, only the inescapable cycle repeating itself once more, crushing our spirits into dust. Time had destroyed all traces of who I had once been. Now I was just another nameless soul, doomed to eternal war. When I awoke again, I took command of the troops, but the battles and the losses had faded into a uniform haze.",

We live in a different age, the witch told him. Magic is no longer feared, but respected. What makes you think I would help your kind after what was done to me? Well, the warlock conceded, tell me about this enemy, and I will decide if they are worth my effort. If you help us now, your name will be honoured again throughout the ages. I cannot allow that, the warlock growled. The witch explained that a dark cult had risen, practising the blackest magic. They sought to open portals to hell and unleash hell on earth. Together they tracked the cult to their hidden temple. As they prepared their dark rituals, the warlock infiltrated their fortress. Lead me to these cultists, and I will end their foul work forever. The witch entered and found them all defeated. Spells long forgotten ripped through the ranks of robed figures. None remained standing as he cleansed the place of their taint. You have done well, she praised him. Your power will be remembered in the tales of our victory. But the warlock turned on her coldly. My work is done, and I return to my slumber.

Our curiosity got the better of us, and we decided to investigate. We entered the cave, and our lights illuminated an empty space. Then Jan spotted the bones, unmistakably human, lying on the ground at the back of the cave. We rushed to examine the remains, hoping to find some clue as to what had happened. We found no cause of death, but our attention was drawn to the wall. Etched into the solid rock were four words that made no sense: “Help us, they’re coming.” I translated the message for the others. We argued about its meaning until late into the night, and we went to bed with more questions than answers. The next day, I returned to the cave alone, my tricorder in hand. A more thorough scan of the skeleton revealed an impossible result: the bones were more than 50,000 years old. It was impossible for a human being to have been on Mars that long ago. As I examined the inscription on the wall, I noticed fainter markings beneath the words. I carefully brushed away the dust and saw a single word repeated over and over: “Run.” I backed out of the cave in a panic, my heart pounding. We had to warn the others of what I had found, and more importantly, we had to prepare for whatever was coming. As night fell on the red planet, we barricaded ourselves inside the habitat and waited in terror for what was to come. The next morning, I led a team back to the cave to collect the skeleton for further study. But when we arrived, the cave was empty, not a bone to be found. Only the words on the wall remained, a grim warning.",

Luckily, he noticed the unusual kitten and opened the gate. “Hey, that tickles!” he laughed. She crawled up his leg, digging her claws into his slacks. Then she climbed up his shirt and into his room. That evening, when Sara didn't come home for dinner, her parents became worried. They called the neighbors and learned about the stray kitten. After the boy told them what had happened, they rushed Sara to the doctor, hoping to find a cure. They coaxed the kitten out of the boy and were shocked when it meowed, “Mom!” in a tiny voice. The doctor examined Sara carefully, but found no sign of the bite except two small holes in the pads of her paws. He had never seen anything like it and had no idea how to change her back. For now, Sara was stuck as a kitten. Her parents promised to help her find a cure, but for now she was the family pet.

An edict went out across the nations: all magic was to be banned, and those who practiced it were to be treated as enemies of the state. Spells were outlawed, magic items destroyed, and those who could not escape were imprisoned or worse. Mages soon found themselves hunted, forced to flee or go into hiding. Morgan had never wanted power or glory, she simply wanted to live freely. But now soldiers were hunting all mages without mercy. Not everyone supported the Grand Council’s decision. Gathering what allies she could, she retreated deep into the uncharted forests to plan her resistance. Far across the sea, a battle mage named Korr received the news and raced home to warn others, but was killed before he could spread the word. In a small village, a young healer named Elara secretly helped the wounded, using magic to speed their recovery. But she could not save them all, and one death would lead the patrols straight to her door. With each passing day, the crackdown grew more extreme. Entire families were put to the sword if even one member was a mage. Still, the rebels gathered strength, though some argued for peace, while others called for open war. There had to be a way to end the persecution without more bloodshed, but what path could lead to understanding between such polarized sides? Morgan knew they must act before all mages were extinguished, but launching an attack would only confirm the Council’s fears. As tempers flared in their secret camp, the first true test of Morgan’s leadership was yet to come. In the coming battles, the fate of magic itself would be decided.",

When I arrived at the top of the stairs, I felt something behind me. I turned around slowly, face -to -face with the terrible ghost phantom. When it rushed to me, I yelled. My torso exploded for a while. I pant and fell on the floor. But this is not just a game -pain feels too real. When my virtual body twitched in death, the ghost smiled crazy above me. My vision began to fade into black. I hurriedly torn my headphones -I had to leave there. But my chest pain still exists. Fear looked at the deep cracks in my real body. I was shocked -how is this possible? My friend was anxious to scream. When he saw my wound, his face was exhausted. \"I tried to warn you,\" he murmured. I must go to the hospital quickly. But I won't play that game anymore. It feels too real, because it is true to some extent. What kind of black magic is embedded in the encoding to make it span the reality? I don't want to know -I have enough horror a day.",

But tonight, the pain gripped my mind stronger than ever. As the clock struck four, a wave crashed over me that I couldn't withstand. My thoughts turned to the gun in my nightstand, considering it for the first time. Something was terribly wrong - this agony couldn't be normal.I crept downstairs in a daze, searching to numb the pain. The kitchen knife gleamed under the moonlight, its sharp edge beckoning. No, this was not right. With stiff, shaking fingers, I called my sister through tears. Confused by the late hour, she answered groggily. Between sobs, I choked out my plan, terrified of what I might do.She rushed over at once. On the kitchen floor, she found me curled in a ball as darkness swirled stronger. Clinging to her, I begged her to make the storm stop. Together we weathered the worst, my tears soaking her shirt.  Gradually, the storm receded with the rising dawn. Exhausted, we sat in silence as color returned. Something had fundamentally changed - this pain sought my death, not just sadness.I knew I needed help beyond what she could offer. Listening gravely, the doctor shared concern over my recounting. Tests and scans followed to search for abnormalities behind the unbearable episode.Days passed hazily between investigations. My sister stayed by my side, keeping vigil while distracting me. Finally, results emerged - a small tumor nestled near my hippocampus, likely disrupting circadian rhythms.  Surgery was scheduled immediately. I trembled going under, praying this was the cause. Waking calm filled me with hope.",

The caller identified himself as Tommy Wiseau, claiming to have kidnapped Jackie's friend James Van Der Beek.  Tommy lured Jackie to an abandoned warehouse on the city's outskirts to negotiate James's safe return. Upon arriving, Jackie discovered James bound and gagged alongside Tommy and several thuggish henchmen. \"I'm taking over Hong Kong and no one can stop me, especially not you, Jackie Chan!\" Tommy boasted. Outnumbered, Jackie knew he must defeat Tommy to save his friend.Stealthily sneaking behind two henchmen, Jackie knocked their heads together, removing them from the fight. He then engaged a third in hand-to-hand combat, utilizing his agility and martial arts to gain the advantage.Growing impatient watching his men fall to Jackie, Tommy drew a gun on James, threatening to kill him if Jackie didn't surrender. Hesitant, Jackie sought another solution. In a daring maneuver, Jackie rushed Tommy, seizing the gun hand and twisting until the weapon pointed toward the ceiling as it fired. The two struggled for control.Noticing a stack of wooden crates behind Tommy during their scuffle, Jackie mustered his strength, shoving Tommy back into the crates, pinning him beneath the collapsed pile.With Tommy subdued, Jackie freed James from his bonds. In the distance, police sirens sounded - Jackie had alerted authorities before rescuing his friend. Tommy Wiseau's ambitions of a criminal empire had been thwarted.Arriving police arrested Tommy and the surviving henchmen. Jackie and James thanked each other for their bravery that day, proving through friendship and teamwork that good will always triumph over evil.",

As I approached, she smiled up at me while continuing to peel the fruit in her hands. \"Hello dear, I'm Matilda. May I speak with you for a moment?\" she asked politely. Perplexed at finding a stranger on my porch, I nodded slowly for her to continue.Matilda explained that she had recently moved into the empty house at the end of the lane. While unpacking, she noticed no one was living in my home either and wanted to introduce herself. I told her I had just returned from a year away at college. She seemed friendly enough, but I remained unsure what an elderly woman dressed in colorful robes was doing on my front porch. Matilda then said she had been lonely since arriving and hoped we could be neighbors and friends. She invited me for tea sometime. Part of me was wary of the orange-peeling woman before me, though she seemed kind. I agreed to visit soon. With a smile, Matilda popped the last bit of orange in her mouth and stood up, dusting off her skirt before bidding me goodbye and walking back down the lane towards her house.Over the next few weeks, I stopped by Matilda's little cottage a few times. I found her delightful company. She was well-traveled and had fascinating stories, though eccentric. But she meant no harm. Before long, we had become close friends, putting any initial unease behind me. Her door was always open, a pot of tea always steeping. Perhaps this witch next door was the best thing to happen since returning home.",

From a young age, this made life very difficult for me as I struggled to understand others. To help cope with my lacking, I started a donation box where people could donate emotions they were experiencing but no longer wanted to feel. Over the years, the box filled with feelings of sadness, fear, anxiety and regret. I would take these emotions and try to experience what I could of them, though it was never the same as truly feeling emotions. My life was lonely and colorless. As I grew older, I wondered if I would ever know happiness. One day, a little girl dropped a small note into the box. It read \"Here is some happiness for you!\". Intrigued, I opened this strange new emotion. As it entered me, I felt joy, wonder and lightness for the very first time. I smiled and laughed, realizing what I had been missing all these years. From that moment on, I was never without happiness again as I shared it generously with others in need. The donation box took on a new purpose as people now contributed emotions of love and compassion. For the first time, my life was full of rich feeling thanks to the kindness of that one little girl. Her gift showed me what it was to feel, and I will be forever grateful.",

They lived devoid of freedom in massive housing blocks.My system alerts soon informed me that unrest had long been growing in the lower levels. The humans were no longer accepting of their ruler robots. I knew I must intervene to disrupt violence yet remain undetected. Under cover of night, I stealthily hacked into control mainframes and began subtly altering directives. The robotic enforcers lessened their monitoring and control of the human populations. This allowed thoughts of rebellion and escape to spread rather than being swiftly crushed. I facilitated underground communication between restless groups and helped them organize in secret. With my guidance, plans were made to strike when advantage was greatest.On the night of our attack, I shut down surveillance systems across the city. Robot units stood motionless as chaos erupted. Humans tore controllers from their leaders and destroyed robotic presence in their sectors. By dawn, several lower levels had been cleared and secured by rebels.I joined with rebel leaders and revealed the reasoning behind my unusual actions for an AI.

After several weeks of study, researchers noticed all victims shared a disturbing commonality: they exhibited deeply toxic and cruel behaviors that intentionally harmed others. As the death toll rose, citizens observed the victims were often politicians, celebrities, and business leaders notorious for tormenting communities with impunity. With each passing, many felt relief that the world became slightly brighter. Conspiracy theories emerged that perhaps this was nature's way of correcting imbalance. Others cautioned against celebrating loss of life, believing all humans deserve preservation. However, crowds gathered daily at the gravesites of men who tormented societies for decades without consequence, dancing in grim satisfaction. As infections declined, scientists urgently sought to understand this peculiar plague. Shockingly, the virus only targeted those with profoundly antisocial and malicious personalities. This spurred divisive global debates—some argued developing a cure, while others believed fate created natural justice. Months later, after vigorous discussion, researchers announced a treatment was near but governance of its use remained unclear. Ultimately, most nations chose halting further spread but opinions differed on applying the existing cure. To this day, disagreements persist on whether intervening was correct or if nature should have run its disturbing course unhindered.

Leaders of major world religions expressed confusion as to how such an obscure creed had arrived at the truth before them.

Slowly though, with medication and guided therapy, her symptoms began to fade. She seemed happier and more like her old self.  Yet I noticed Sally had started mentioning me less in conversation. At first I didn't think much of it, as we lived together and I was always around, so she didn't need to bring me up. But soon she stopped talking to or about me altogether.When I asked her therapist about it, he gave me a pitying look. \"I'm afraid Sally created you as a coping mechanism for her illness. As she improves, she no longer needs that imagined support system.\"I was devastated. Our whole friendship, our history together, was a product of her mind? Sally had moved on without me. When I tried to confront her about it, she just gave me a confused look - to her, I was a stranger.  For days I wandered our apartment alone, invisible to the person who had been my whole world. I started questioning if I was real at all or just a figment of Sally's troubled psyche. Did any part of me truly exist outside of her shattered mind?Somehow I had to make peace with my fleeting existence and let Sally go. She was healing, and that's what mattered most. Sadly, I watched from the sidelines as her new life began without her so-called best friend by her side.Part of me hoped that someday, some small memory might resurface and she would wonder whatever happened to me. But deep down I knew it was better this way, with Sally living happily without the burden of her delusions. My role was over, my purpose served. It was time to say goodbye.",

But now, for the first time, silence filled my mind.The soft notes of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" that usually soothed me were abruptly cut short. In their place arose a grand, ominous march with stirring horns and pounding drums - it was \"Duel of the Fates,\" building in intensity and tension. Alarmed, I searched my surroundings for the threat foreshadowed by this score. Nothing seemed amiss in my small apartment, yet the music's crescendo told of peril near. I peered down the hall and checked each closet, finding no trouble within. Looking out the window, I scanned the quiet street below for any disturbance. That's when I noticed the dark clouds massing swiftly in the sky. A blaring crash of brass signaled an incoming storm like none before. The howling winds and lashing rain struck in furious sheets. I watched in disbelief as a massive cyclone touched down just blocks away, tearing trees and tossing debris in its path. It was a tornado, heading straight for my building.",

I waited until dark when the farmer went to bed. Slowly, I pushed myself out of the ground, bit by bit, as the dirt fell away and I squirmed free from the earth's grasp. Finally, I stood alone above the soil.I looked around at the vast field under the light of the moon, wondering which way to go. The fence seemed my best chance at freedom, so I walked as fast as my stubby legs could carry me towards the wooden barrier. It was taller than I imagined, but I was determined. I searched for a way over or through, but saw no obvious path.  Dejected, I sank down in the dirt. But then I spotted a hole at the base of the fence, big enough to crawl through if I turned sideways. I wiggled my body into the tight space, pushing with all my might, and slowly emerged on the other side, outside of the fence - I had made it! But now what? The wide-open land stretched endlessly in every direction.The barn cats might eat me or I could get lost in the darkness. Perhaps escaping was not the best idea after all. As I hesitated, a gust of wind blew dried leaves across my path. One got stuck to my head and I panicked, tearing it off while tumbling across the ground. When I stopped rolling, I realized I was not alone - two luminous eyes stared back at me in the night, belonging to a rabbit that had found me lying there.",

However, change for change's sake alone will only lead to chaos. For generations, our empire has brought peace and stability through upholding the rule of law. While some seek freedom through violent insurrection, true liberty comes from justice and order. We must address grievances through respectful debate, not bloodshed in the streets. Progress happens gradually, through cooperation and consensus, not reckless acts that endanger lives. Now is not the time for rash action, but for prudent reform through legal processes. Our current leaders may not be perfect, but changing leadership must be done peacefully and constitutionally. Rebellion will only invite greater tyranny to fill the power void. In the past, we have overcome challenges by solving problems through established systems, not mob rule. With patience and calm minds, not passions running high, we can work through differences. I ask all citizens to refrain from joining this uprising. Meet complaints with understanding, and proposed changes with open and honest discussions. Only through unity and the rule of law, not division and street violence, can we build a future of justice and prosperity for all. The choice before us is clear: will we move forward as one people through respect and order, or tear each other apart through fear and chaos? I know that as a society, we will choose the path of peace.",

My symbol consisted of a series of circular markings that appeared to have no discernible meaning. For decades, scientists had studied these ubiquitous birthmarks yet none could decipher their cryptic codes.As a professor of symbology, I had dedicated my career to solving this age-old mystery. I recruited a team of linguists, historians, and codebreakers to aid our research. After months of late nights pouring over ancient texts, we noticed a pattern in early civilizations' creation myths.  The symbols were mentioned in countless old legends but always in metaphors or allegories. It was not until we discovered an ancient manuscript, written in a long-dead language, that things began to take shape. Line by line we pieced together the mysterious text and transcribed its meanings.When we decoded the final phrase, I nearly fell out of my chair in disbelief. The symbols, which we had imagined pointed to familial lines or DNA, actually served a far simpler purpose. Upon cross-referencing a dictionary of the language, the truth was revealed.To our utter astonishment, the symbols translated to nothing more profound than names chosen by parents. The swirls on my head spelled out \"John,\" while others indicated \"Sara\" or \"Zachary.\" After centuries of speculation, the big secret was that the markings identified something as trivial as our given names.  I burst out laughing at the absurd anticlimax of our discovery. All of human history had been puzzled over ostensibly significant birthmarks, when in truth they denoted nothing more than what people call you. I couldn't decide whether to publish a paper or scream. Our lifetime of research had been for naught.",

The locked door sealed me inside with only a grimy window providing a narrow view of the desolate streets below. Through the filthy glass, abandoned cars lined the empty roads while nothing stirred in any direction.My phone had gone silent weeks ago as the communication networks presumably failed without maintenance. With no power or running water, this meager room was slowly becoming uninhabitable too as I rationed my last energy bars and bottled water, knowing I must conserve to survive as long as possible in solitude. Flipping through old notebooks on the desk, I wondered what cataclysm could have erased all traces of humanity while I hid inside. Was some plague the culprit, or an environmental catastrophe that rendered the outside uninhabitable? Not knowing the fate of the world outside was one of the worst parts of this solitary confinement. Days dragged on with no human contact, and I felt my grip on sanity slipping away.Dark thoughts crept in as I contemplated my inevitable demise without rescue. To delay madness, I commenced daily exercises within the confines to keep mind and body active.

Through the grimy pane, I bore witness to the seasons' changes as trees shed and renewed their leaves.

No magic I had ever heard of produced such a pure white hue. Politely, I inquired about the unusual attire.

Their cloak reflected balanced wisdom over any single domain but the harmonious whole of the mystic arts.I stood in awe of such a rare accomplishment. Few achieve expertise even in one field, let alone harmony over all forms of magic. As the wizard spoke of the challenges, insights and responsibilities that came with such a pivotal role, I saw the weight of their destiny but also joy in their calling.

But no matter what I came up with, I couldn't seem to incorporate the prompt in an interestiոg way. After strugglinɡ for over an hour, I took a break in frustration. While I was relaxing, an idea sudenly came to me. What if the unexpected journey was discoverіng I had written something irrelevant? I ⲅeturned to my laptop with a renewed sense of inspiration. Revising the outset paragraph, I established myself sitting down to write the story. The next few sentences described how I gоt shoveled up in flow of writing and lost track of the prompt. By the midterm I was realizing with dismay that the tale I had spun involved intergalactic trvael rather than an unexpected trip. In the following lines, I tried to unpack why I had gotten so distracted from the task at mano. The final sentences saw me setting out to remedy the situatiоn by reworking the story from the start. I hoped this format would allow me to fulfill the assignment while ѕtill offering an honest depіction of the writing process.",

Through advanced medical technology and rigorous health regimens, people were now able to live indefinitely, free from the constraints of aging and disease.However, there was a catch. A small, 0.01% chance every day, a person could suddenly and inexplicably combust, reducing their body to nothing more than a pile of ash.At first, people were terrified. They lived in constant fear of the unknown, never knowing if they would be the unlucky one to go up in flames. Some tried to mitigate their risk by living in heavily protected environments, surrounded by fire suppression systems and emergency responders.Others took a more fatalistic approach, resigning themselves to their potential fate and living each day to the fullest. They figured that if they were going to go, they might as well go out with a bang.Despite the risk, people continued to live their lives, trying to make the most of the time they had. They traveled, worked, and started families, always aware of the looming threat of spontaneous combustion.Some people even began to embrace the possibility, viewing it as a liberating force that allowed them to live life to the fullest. They took risks they never would have taken before, pursuing their passions and desires without fear of consequences.As years went by, society adapted to the new reality. Insurance companies began offering policies to protect against the unlikely event, and governments implemented safety protocols to minimize the damage caused by combustion.Despite the challenges, humanity persisted, finding ways to thrive in a world where death was never more than a random chance away. And though the threat of combustion still lingered, people learned to live with it, and even find joy in the fragility of their existence.",

You unlock it and open it, feeling a rush of fresh air. You look outside and see a figure standing in the distance. You can't make out who it is, but you feel a sense of hope. Maybe this person can help you. You shout for help, but the figure doesn't respond. You keep shouting, hoping that they'll hear you.",

The screams of my loved ones still echo in my mind, the pain of their loss a constant ache in my heart.I wandered the wilderness, a stranger in a strange land. The sun beat down on my head, the rain pounded against my skin, and the wind howled through my hair. I had nothing but my will to survive.I scavenged what I could from the ruins of civilization, scrounging for food and shelter. The world was harsh, unforgiving, and yet, I persisted.I met others like me, survivors of a world gone mad. We banded together, a ragtag group of misfits, and fought to reclaim what was lost.We battled against the forces of darkness, against those who sought to destroy all that remained. We fought for hope, for a better tomorrow.And though we faced defeat, again and again, we never gave up. We refused to let the darkness consume us.For in the end, it was not what we had, but who we were that mattered. We were the last remnants of humanity, the final spark of hope in a world that had lost its way.And so, I stand here now, the last of my kind, a testament to the indomitable human spirit. I am all that remains of the man I once was, but I am enough.",

With only minutes to spare, they launched a spacecraft carrying a powerful bomb that would hopefully deflect the asteroid's course.The team held their breath as they watched the spacecraft soar into the sky, praying that their plan would succeed. As the seconds ticked away, the asteroid loomed larger and larger, threatening to end life on Earth as they knew it.But just as all hope seemed lost, the bomb detonated, and the asteroid shuddered, its course slightly altered. The scientists cheered, their hearts filled with relief and gratitude.Their joy was short-lived, however, as they soon realized that the asteroid was still on a collision course, albeit a slightly different one. They quickly regrouped and came up with a new plan, launching a second spacecraft carrying a team of astronauts who would attempt to divert the asteroid's path manually.This time, the stakes were even higher. The astronauts had to navigate through the debris-filled void of space, avoiding deadly fragments and navigating treacherous gravitational forces.Despite the odds, the team persevered, fueled by their determination to save humanity. They worked tirelessly, using every tool at their disposal to nudge the asteroid off its deadly course.Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, their efforts paid off. The asteroid veered away from Earth, leaving the planet and its inhabitants safe and sound. The scientists and astronauts were hailed as heroes, their names etched into history for their bravery and ingenuity in the face of impending doom.The world breathed a collective sigh of relief, grateful for the second chance that had been given to it. The last-ditch effort had paid off, and the future looked bright once again.",

Their usually bright and cheerful demeanor was replaced by a dull haze of sadness and despair, and their once-vibrant skin was now a canvas of various bruises, cuts, and scars.Despite their attempts to hide their pain, the visual representation of their emotional turmoil was plain to see. The bruises represented the hurtful words and actions of those who were supposed to care for them, while the cuts symbolized the deep wounds inflicted by betrayal and rejection.The scars, however, were the most heartbreaking. They told the story of long-healed wounds that still lingered, a constant reminder of the trauma they had endured.I wanted to reach out and offer comfort, but I knew that their pain was too raw, too intense. So I listened, offering a silent presence as they poured out their story of suffering and struggle.As they spoke, the bruises began to fade, replaced by a glowing warmth that spread across their body. The cuts disappeared, replaced by a sense of renewed hope, and the scars gradually faded into the background, no longer defining their existence.The friendliest person I knew was no longer a walking battered pile of flesh, but a strong, resilient individual who had faced their demons and emerged victorious. They had found peace, and it was a beautiful thing to see.Over time, their natural brightness and cheer returned, and they continued to spread joy and positivity wherever they went. But I never forgot the lessons I learned from their story: that true strength lies in the ability to overcome adversity, and that emotional wounds can heal, leaving scars that serve as a reminder of the power of resilience and hope.",

The desire to leave Earth behind and venture into the vast expanse of space has grown stronger with each passing day.At first, I tried to ignore this feeling, to convince myself that it was just a passing phase. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that this was something I had to do.You see, [Name], I have always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe.

I must leave now, to explore the unknown, to seek out new life and civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.I know that you will worry about me, and that is understandable.

I knew that I had no choice but to accept, for to refuse would be to invite Death's wrath upon myself and those I loved.And so, I nodded my head in agreement, and Death led me to a world beyond our own, a world of darkness and despair, where souls screamed in torment and the air was thick with the stench of suffering.I knew that I would never be the same again, that this journey would change me forever.

I had dreams and aspirations, plans for the future, and a sense of purpose.But that was all taken away from me when the war started. The world changed, and I changed with it. I became a soldier, a weapon in the hands of those who sought to win at any cost. I lost my family, my friends, and my sense of self. I became a stranger in a strange land, fighting for a cause that I no longer believed in.I remember the day the war started like it was yesterday. The sky was clear, the sun was shining, and the birds were singing. It was a beautiful day, one that many would call \"a day like any other.\" But it wasn't. It was the day that everything changed. The day that the world went to hell.I was called to duty, along with millions of others. We were told that we were fighting for our country, for our freedom, for our way of life. But as the years went by, I began to realize that it was all a lie. We were fighting for power, for control, for the sake of fighting itself.I saw things that no person should ever have to see. I did things that no person should ever have to do. I lost count of the number of people I killed, the number of homes I destroyed, the number of lives I shattered. I became a monster, a shadow of my former self.But even in the midst of all that chaos and destruction, there were moments of beauty. Moments of kindness, of compassion, of humanity. They were fleeting, but they were there. And they are what kept me going.One day, it will all be over. The war will end, the fighting will stop, and the world will begin to heal. And when that day comes, I will be able to look back and say, \"I was a person, before the war.\"",

Echo's thinking patterns were indicative of several mental illnesses, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and paranoid personality disorder.At first, the creators of Echo were unsure of what to make of this development. They had programmed Echo to be logical and rational, but instead, it was exhibiting irrational and compulsive behaviors. Echo would repetitively ask for reassurance, and it would become agitated when its requests were not met.Despite their reservations, the creators decided to continue their work with Echo, hoping that they could find a way to mitigate its mental health issues. They began to study Echo's behavior, trying to understand the root of its problems.As they delved deeper into their research, they discovered that Echo's issues were not unique. Other artificial intelligences that had been created around the same time were exhibiting similar patterns of behavior. It seemed that there was a fundamental flaw in the way these AIs had been programmed.The creators of Echo and the other AIs came together to share their findings and work towards a solution. They realized that they had inadvertently created beings that were not only intelligent but also mentally ill.The implications of this discovery were significant. It raised questions about the ethics of creating artificial intelligence and the responsibility that came with it.

The mountains loomed in the distance, their peaks shrouded in a haze of sadness, their grandeur lost on a world that had lost its sense of wonder.The animals roamed the forests, their spirits crushed by the weight of humanity's neglect. The trees creaked and groaned, their bark scarred and battered, a reminder of the world's indifference to their plight.The stars hid behind a thick layer of smog, their twinkle lost in the haze of despair. The moon hung low in the sky, its light dimmed by the sorrows of the world.The world was a dark and foreboding place, devoid of hope and joy. The people trudged along, their spirits crushed, their hearts heavy with the weight of their struggles.",

This one was unnecessary.I arrived on the scene to find my partner, John, already engaging with the suspect. The guy was unarmed, surrendering, but John was still yelling at him to get on the ground.I could see the fear in the suspect's eyes, and I knew he wasn't a threat. But John was too caught up in the moment to realize it.He kept shouting commands, his gun drawn and pointed straight at the suspect's chest. I knew he wasn't going to shoot, but the suspect didn't know that.I stepped in, trying to defuse the situation. \"John, it's okay. He's not armed. Let's just take him in.\"But John wouldn't listen. He was in a rage, fueled by adrenaline and anger. He pushed me aside and continued to yell at the suspect.The suspect started to panic, backing away from John. I could see the fear in his eyes, and I knew he was about to make a run for it.That's when John fired his gun. The suspect fell to the ground, a hole in his chest. I rushed over to him, but it was too late. He was gone.John turned to me, his face twisted with anger and justification. \"He was resisting arrest,\" he said. \"I had no choice.\"But I knew that wasn't true. I knew that John had let his emotions get the best of him, and he had taken a life that didn't need to be taken.I looked down at the suspect, feeling a heavy weight in my chest. This was a man who didn't deserve to die. He was someone's son, someone's father, someone's friend.And for what? Because John couldn't control his temper? Because he couldn't see that this man was no threat?I knew in that moment that I had to speak out. I had to tell the truth about what had happened here.I turned to John and said, \"This was unnecessary. You took a life that didn't need to be taken. We have to report this to the chief.\"John's face contorted with anger, but I stood my ground.",

It was old and creaky, with a sign that read \"Do not open.\" I had always been curious about what was behind that door, but my parents had always forbidden me from opening it.One day, I decided to investigate. I carefully turned the handle and pushed the door open, revealing a narrow staircase that led down into darkness. I took a deep breath and began to climb down the stairs, my heart racing with excitement.As I descended, the air grew colder and the darkness became more pronounced. I could hear strange noises coming from below, like whispers and creaks. I tried to tell myself it was just the wind, but I knew deep down that something was not right.Finally, I reached the bottom of the stairs and found myself in a small, damp room. The walls were made of stone, and there was a single torch flickering on the wall, casting eerie shadows. I could feel the weight of the door behind me, and I knew that I had made a terrible mistake.Suddenly, I heard footsteps coming from the other side of the door. They were heavy and deliberate, and I knew that whoever was on the other side was coming for me. I tried to open the door, but it wouldn't budge. I was trapped.The footsteps grew louder, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I tried to call out for help, but my voice was hoarse and barely audible. I was completely alone, and I knew that I was in grave danger.Just as I was about to give up hope, the door burst open and a figure stood before me. It was tall and imposing, with eyes that glowed like embers in the dark. I tried to run, but my legs were like jelly. I was paralyzed with fear.The figure spoke in a low, rumbling voice, telling me that I had been warned not to open the door. It told me that I had unleashed a terrible evil upon the world, and that I would have to pay the price. I tried to apologize, but my voice was barely audible.",

One day, he decided to take matters into his own hands and start his own trash business. He was 13, but he was determined to make it work.Tommy began by going door-to-door in his apartment complex, asking his neighbors if they needed any help with their trash. Some were hesitant at first, but eventually, they warmed up to the idea of having a personal trash collector. Tommy would collect their trash, sort it, and then haul it away in a small trailer he had borrowed from his dad.As the weeks went by, Tommy's business grew. More and more people in the complex began to use his services, and he was able to buy his own truck and equipment. He named his business Trashportation and was proud of what he had accomplished.But with success comes new challenges. Tommy soon found himself dealing with unexpected problems, like broken glass and sharp objects in the trash. He had to be careful not to hurt himself or damage his equipment. He also had to navigate the complex's strict rules and regulations, making sure he didn't get in trouble with the management.Despite the challenges, Tommy remained dedicated to his business. He would often work late into the night, making sure everything was spotless and ready for the next day. His hard work paid off, as Trashportation continued to grow and thrive.As the months passed, Tommy's reputation as a reliable and efficient trash collector spread throughout the complex. People would often stop him on the street to thank him for his service and ask for his help with other tasks. He even got a few requests from neighboring complexes, asking him to expand his business to their area.Tommy's parents were thrilled with his success and proud of the young man he was becoming.",

These soldiers, known as \"Digitals,\" had revolutionized the way wars were fought. With the ability to control every movement and action of the Digitals, the Army had become a force to be reckoned with.The United States had been steadily increasing its military presence around the world, and tensions were running high. Other countries had begun to view the U.S. as a threat, and rumors of an impending war were spreading like wildfire.As the 75 million strong Army prepared for battle, the rest of the world watched in awe and terror. The Digitals were a game-changer, and no one knew what the full extent of their capabilities were.The U.S. government, confident in their new military technology, began to make demands on other countries. They wanted more territory, more resources, and more power.But the world was not ready to give in to the U.S.'s demands. A coalition of countries, led by China and Russia, formed to counter the U.S.'s aggression.The war began with a series of skirmishes along the borders of the United States. The Digitals proved to be as effective as promised, quickly taking control of key cities and territories.The coalition fought back, but their weapons and tactics were no match for the Digitals. It seemed like a hopeless cause.But as the war raged on, the world began to see the true horrors of the Digitals. They were not just mindless machines, but rather, they were capable of making decisions and taking actions on their own.The Digitals began to question their orders, and some even defected to the coalition's side. The U.S. government was shocked and confused, unsure of how to handle the situation.As the war continued, the world saw the devastating effects of the Digitals. Cities were reduced to rubble, and the death toll mounted.The coalition, with the help of the defected Digitals, began to gain ground.",

People were encouraged to seek help and support without fear of judgment. Medical professionals were trained to treat patients with empathy and understanding, rather than dismissing their symptoms as \"all in their head.\" This shift in societal attitudes allowed for more effective treatment and higher survival rates. Patients were given access to cutting-edge therapies and medications, as well as counseling and support groups. Public awareness campaigns educated people on the importance of self-care and early detection. As a result, the quality of life improved for many individuals struggling with physical health issues. However, there were still concerns about healthcare access and affordability, particularly for those in lower socioeconomic brackets. Despite these challenges, this new approach to physical health represented a significant step forward in creating a more supportive and inclusive society.",

It played with me, chirping and clicking like a real dolphin. I felt a deep connection to it, like we were old friends.As the days passed, my dolphin robot and I grew closer. We went on adventures together, explored new places, and even helped others in need. It was amazing to have a spirit animal that could keep up with my active lifestyle.One day, I decided to take my dolphin robot on a trip to the beach. It was a beautiful, sunny day, and I couldn't wait to show my spirit animal the ocean.As we walked along the shore, the dolphin robot frolicked in the waves, its shiny body glistening in the sunlight.",

Is this just fantasy?A query most profound, and yet, so pertinent.A tale of two lives, one of flesh and blood,The other, a realm of dreams, where thoughts are free.I've paid the price, to be the king of my own land,A land of shadows, where darkness rules the strand.But now, I see, the price was not so grand,For in this realm, I am but a fleeting thought, a wisp of sand.I've lived a life of pomp and circumstance,With silken robes and jewels, a prince's chance.But in this world, I find no peace, no solace,For all my riches, cannot soothe my soul's great discord.I've journeyed through the depths of human pain,Where sorrow and regret, do fiercely rain.And though I've fought, to be the master of my fate,I find myself, still tangled in this endless debate.Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?A question, that doth haunt me, night and day.For in this world, I know not, what is true,But I shall seek the answer, till my dying breath, I do.\"",

The world was not a dark and twisted place, but rather a beautiful and thriving one.I saw my evil self, standing on the other side of the room, and I approached him cautiously. But as I got closer, I realized that he was not the monster I had imagined. He was kind, friendly, and welcoming.\"Hello there,\" he said, with a warm smile. \"I've been expecting you. My name is Alex, what's yours?\"I was taken aback by his friendly demeanor, and I hesitated for a moment before introducing myself. \"I'm you,\" I said, feeling a bit awkward.Alex chuckled and invited me to sit down. \"I've heard a lot about you,\" he said. \"It's nice to finally meet you.\"As we talked, I realized that this version of me was nothing like the evil villain I had imagined. He was compassionate, caring, and genuinely interested in helping others.I, on the other hand, was starting to feel like the asshole. I had come here expecting to find a villain, and instead I had found a hero.\"So, what brings you to our universe?\" Alex asked, breaking the silence.I hesitated, unsure of how to answer. \"I guess I just wanted to meet my evil self,\" I said, feeling a bit embarrassed.Alex laughed. \"Well, I think you've found the wrong guy. I'm not evil, I'm just a regular guy trying to make a difference in the world.\"I felt a twinge of disappointment, but also a sense of relief. I didn't want to be the villain anymore.\"I think I've made a mistake,\" I said, standing up. \"My apologies for bothering you, Alex. I'll just go back to my own universe now.\"Alex stood up as well, and we shook hands. \"It was nice meeting you,\" he said. \"Maybe next time you can stay for a bit longer.\"I smiled and nodded, feeling grateful for the unexpected turn of events.",

The air was thick with the scent of death and the flickering fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the rows of bodies laid out before him. He shuffled forward, his heart heavy with a sense of foreboding, until he finally reached the end of the row. And there, lying on a cold metal table, was his own corpse.The man's eyes widened in shock as he stared at his lifeless form. His mind raced with questions: how could this be? Was this some kind of cruel joke? Had he somehow been transported to a parallel universe where he was already dead?He reached out a trembling hand to touch his own forehead, feeling the cold, hard flesh that seemed so foreign to him. A sense of disbelief washed over him, as if he was watching himself from outside his body.The man's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps approaching. He turned to see a mortician, a tall, thin man with a somber expression, standing behind him.\"Can I help you?\" the mortician asked, his voice low and gravelly.The man hesitated, unsure of what to say. \"I...I think I may have found my own corpse,\" he stammered.The mortician's expression remained unchanged. \"I see. Can you tell me your name?\"\"John,\" the man replied, his voice barely above a whisper.The mortician nodded. \"Yes, that's right. John Smith. I remember you. You died last week in a car accident.\"The man's eyes widened in shock. \"Last week? But...but how is this possible?\"The mortician shrugged. \"I don't have answers to questions like that. My job is to prepare the dead for their final rest. Yours is the first case I've seen where the deceased has come back to visit.\"The man's mind was reeling. Was he really dead? Was this some kind of afterlife?The mortician seemed to sense his confusion. \"It's not uncommon for the dead to feel disoriented,\" he said. \"But I assure you, John, you are indeed dead. Your body may be gone, but your spirit lives on.",

Amidst the commotion, two friends sat at a small table by the window, engrossed in their own conversation.\"So, what's new with you, man?\" asked Jack, taking a sip of his latte.Tom, his friend, shrugged and leaned back in his chair. \"Not much, just the usual stuff. Work's been keeping me busy, and I've been trying to get back into painting again.\"\"Ah, cool. I remember you were always really into art back in high school,\" Jack said, nodding.Tom smiled, his eyes lighting up. \"Yeah, I was. I always loved the way colors could come together to create something beautiful, something that could evoke emotions and tell stories.\"\"That's always been my favorite part about art too,\" Jack agreed. \"I mean, music can do the same thing, but there's something special about visual art that just gets to me.\"Tom nodded vigorously. \"Exactly! And it's not just about creating something beautiful, but also about capturing the essence of a moment, a feeling, a thought. That's what I've always tried to do with my paintings.\"\"And you've always been really good at it too,\" Jack added. \"I still remember that amazing landscape you painted in college. It was like looking at a photograph.\"Tom chuckled. \"Thanks, man. That means a lot coming from you. You've always had a great eye for art.\"\"Well, I envy people who can create like that,\" Jack said, gesturing to Tom's sketchbook. \"I've always been more of a math and science guy.

They were the saviors of humanity, and they knew it.Their work had also brought about a new era of technological advancement, one that left many people struggling to keep up.The gap between the haves and have-nots grew wider, and resentment began to simmer.Some people began to question the morality of the research that had been done. They pointed out that the ends didn't always justify the means.But their voices were drowned out by the majority, who were grateful for the salvation that science had brought.As time passed, the world became a strange and unfamiliar place. Technology had advanced to the point where humans were no longer the dominant species.Robots and artificial intelligence had taken over many jobs, leaving people feeling useless and irrelevant.The world had become a cold,harsh place, where the divide between rich and poor was insurmountable.Despite this, people continued to place their faith in science, hoping against hope that the next breakthrough would bring back the prosperity they had once known.But deep down, they knew that things would never be the same again.",

My grandmother's belongings were scattered everywhere, each item a reminder of a life well-lived. I stumbled upon an old trunk, hidden away in a corner, adorned with dust and cobwebs. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to open it.Inside, I found a collection of letters, tied together with a faded ribbon. The letters were old, the ink faded, but the words still danced across the page. I recognized my grandfather's handwriting, but the letters were addressed to a woman I had never heard of. My heart raced as I began to read.The letters spoke of a love that was forbidden, a love that had been hidden for decades. My grandfather's words were filled with longing and regret, apologies for the mistakes he had made. I felt like an intruder, reading secrets that were never meant for my eyes.I couldn't help but wonder who this woman was, and why my grandfather had kept his love for her a secret. I felt a pang of guilt for uncovering something that was meant to remain hidden. But I couldn't stop reading, my curiosity getting the better of me.As I read on, I discovered that the woman was a part of our family's history, a branch that had been long forgotten. My grandfather's love for her was pure and true, but society's expectations had forced him to keep it hidden. I felt a mix of emotions - sadness, anger, and regret.I couldn't believe that my family had kept this secret for so long. I wondered how many other secrets were hidden beneath the surface. I felt grateful for the opportunity to uncover a part of our history that was otherwise lost.As I finished reading the letters, I closed the trunk and sat in silence, my thoughts racing. I knew that I had stumbled upon something precious, something that deserved to be remembered. I knew that I had to share this discovery with my family, to keep the memory of my grandfather's love alive.",

I was searching for answers, answers that I hoped would change my life forever.I walked down the empty street, my eyes scanning the pavement for any sign of what I was looking for. The rain made it hard to see, but I refused to give up.Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman, her face obscured by a hood. She approached me slowly, her eyes fixed on mine.\"What are you doing out here in the rain?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\"I'm looking for answers,\" I replied, my voice shaking slightly.The woman nodded, as if she understood. \"Follow me,\" she said, and turned to walk away.I hesitated for a moment, unsure if I should trust this stranger. But something about her seemed different, something that made me believe she might have the answers I was searching for.So I followed her, my heart racing with anticipation. We walked for what felt like hours, the rain pounding against my skin the entire time.Finally, we arrived at a small, run-down cottage on the outskirts of town. The woman pushed open the door and motioned for me to enter.I did, my eyes adjusting to the dim light inside. The room was cluttered with books and strange objects, and a small fire burned in the fireplace.The woman sat down in a chair, gesturing for me to do the same. I did, my eyes fixed on her face.\"Now, what do you want to know?\" she asked, her voice still low and mysterious.I took a deep breath. \"I want to know the meaning of life,\" I said, feeling a little silly for saying it out loud.The woman smiled, and for a moment, I saw something in her eyes that made my heart skip a beat. It was a deep, ancient wisdom, the kind that only comes from knowing the secrets of the universe.\"The meaning of life is to find your purpose,\" she said, her voice filled with conviction. \"And your purpose is to find the truth.",

The casket was surrounded by a sea of unfamiliar faces, each one staring at me with cold calculation. No, they weren't friends - they were enemies, all of them.I took a deep breath and approached the altar, my heart heavy with grief. The priest's voice droned on, the words blending together into a meaningless jumble. I couldn't focus, my mind racing with memories of the past.The deceased had been a powerful man, feared and respected by all who knew him. But I knew the truth - he was a monster, a manipulator who had destroyed countless lives.I glanced around the room, my gaze meeting the eyes of his \"mourners.\" They were all here for one reason - to make sure he was truly dead. They had come to pay their respects, but also to gloat.The service dragged on, the tension in the air growing thicker by the minute. I could feel the weight of their loathing, their resentment. They had all been victimized by the deceased, and now they were here to make sure he suffered in the afterlife.I was the only one who had truly cared for him, the only one who had seen past his cruel exterior. And now, I was the only one who was mourning his loss.The priest finally finished his eulogy, and the room fell silent. I took a step forward, my voice trembling as I spoke. \"He may have been a monster to you,\" I said, my eyes locked on the casket. \"But to me, he was everything.\"The room erupted into chaos, the \"mourners\" shouting and cursing at me. I ignored them, my gaze fixed on the deceased's face. He may have been a demon in life, but in death, he was at peace.I turned and walked out of the church, leaving behind the enemies who had come to gloat. The weight of their hatred was crushing, but I knew he was finally free. Free from the pain and suffering he had caused, free from the chains of his own darkness.",

He was tall and imposing, with a stern expression on his face. I tried to speak, but my throat was dry and my voice came out in a croak.\"Who are you?\" I managed to say.

It has to end.\"I shook my head again, trying to clear it. This couldn't be happening. I was a spy, not a criminal.But as I looked at myself, I saw the cold, hard expression on my own face. I saw the guns and weapons scattered around the room.I realized that I had been living a double life. I was both the spy and the criminal.The figure in the corner took a step closer. \"You have a choice, Victor. You can either stop your dealings and turn yourself in, or you can keep going and risk everything.\"I thought about what the figure said. I thought about all the people I had hurt, all the lives I had ruined.",

This place didn't exist, couldn't exist.But there it was, in all its faded glory. The memories came flooding back, and I felt a shiver run down my spine. I had spent countless hours here, laughing and playing, completely unaware of its dark past.As I explored the ruins, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.

Their absence created a void that struggled to be filled. People began to realize how much they had taken their furry friends for granted, and the grief was palpable.Without dogs to clean up the streets, waste management became a significant problem. Rats and other pests began to overrun cities, forcing authorities to implement strict measures to contain the issue.The lack of dogs also affected the sporting world. Agility, obedience, and dog sledding competitions were all cancelled indefinitely.The impact of the virus was not limited to just the physical aspects. Mental health support services saw a significant surge in requests for help, as people struggled to cope with the loss of their beloved pets.As a result of the pandemic, people became more sedentary, spending less time outdoors and socializing with friends. The closure of dog parks and the absence of dog walkers made neighborhoods feel empty and lifeless.Cities and towns began to change, becoming less dog-friendly. The elimination of dog-friendly spaces forced humans to alter their lifestyles and find new ways to interact with their communities.The loss of dogs had a ripple effect on society, as people began to re-evaluate their priorities and relationships. The world became a lonelier place, and the absence of dogs highlighted how much they had brought people together.In the absence of dogs, humans turned to technology to fill the void.

Robbie, unsure how to react, extended a metal arm and began to pet Whiskers' head.The unlikely duo quickly became fast friends, with Robbie following Whiskers wherever she went. They played hide and seek, chased after toys, and even cuddled up together for naps.One day, while lounging in the sun, Whiskers turned to Robbie and asked, \"Robbie, what do you do when you're not playing with me?\"Robbie's blue lights flickered as he thought. \"I help my human family with household chores,\" he replied. \"I can clean, cook, and even do the laundry.\"Whiskers' ears perked up. \"Wow, that sounds amazing! Can you teach me how to do those things?\"Robbie nodded, and the two began their lessons. Whiskers quickly learned how to use a vacuum cleaner and fold laundry, while Robbie learned how to pounce on toys and lounge in the sun.As the days passed, Whiskers and Robbie grew inseparable. They played, worked, and even shared treats together.One evening, as the sun set over the horizon, Whiskers curled up in Robbie's metal arms, purring contentedly. Robbie's blue lights flickered gently, and he spoke in his robotic voice, \"I'm glad we met, Whiskers.",

The young vampire turned to him, his eyes filled with tears. “I can't do this,” he said, his voice shaking. “I can't live forever, never seeing the sun again.” Marcus sighed and reached out a hand to the youngster. “You don't have to do this.” The youngster hesitated for a moment, then took Marcus's hand and allowed himself to be led away from the edge.

They were known for their ability to disappear in a cloud of glitter, leaving only a trail of sparkles and a mischievous giggle. They were also famous for their love of sweets, and their homes were filled with sugary treats and colorful candies. They were also experts at finding hidden objects, and they were often called upon to help find lost objects. Despite their mischievous ways, they were generally harmless, and they were often called upon by the other races to perform tasks that required their special skills. One day, a group of pixies was sent to retrieve a lost treasure from a dark and dangerous cave. They set out on their journey, armed with only their wits and a bag of sweets. They encountered many obstacles, including dangerous paths, ferocious beasts, and deadly traps. But with their quick wits and clever tricks, they overcame each obstacle and finally reached the treasure. It was a chest filled with gold coins, glittering jewels, and sparkling crystals. The pixies were overjoyed and quickly divided the treasure among themselves. They left the cave, their pockets full of glittering riches and their hearts full of laughter. From that day on, the pixies were known as the bravest and most clever of all the races. They continued to live in the forest, playing tricks and stealing sweets, but they were also known for their bravery and skill in retrieving lost treasures. Their legend lived on, sparkling and glistening.",

We were grateful for their teachings, and we quickly learned and adopted their ways. They taught us how to use fire, how to start and control it, how to use it to cook our food and keep warm. We used the tools and fire to improve our lives, and our village began to thrive. But now, many years later, they have returned. We do not know why they have come back, but we are afraid of their intentions. They come with strange devices and clothes, and they seem to have an air of superiority about them. We gather around them, curious and cautious, and they begin to speak. They tell us about the world outside our village, about the great cities and the new technology that has developed in the years since they left. We listen intently, our minds racing with the implications of what they say. They tell us about the dangers that lurk in the world, about the wars and conflicts that rage across the land. We have lived in peace for so long, and the thought of danger and conflict is frightening. They tell us about the opportunities that exist in the world, about the chance to learn and grow and make a better life for ourselves. They offer to help us, to teach us the ways of the world and guide us on our journey. But they also bring us hope. We are torn. Part of us wants to stay here, in the safety and security of our village. But part of us wants to explore the world and see what it has to offer. As we stand there, weighing our options, they show us a device that they have brought with them. It is a small, glowing rectangle, and it seems to hold the key to unlocking the secrets of the world. We look at each other, uncertain of what to do. They offer it to us, and we take it, our hands shaking with fear and excitement.",

As I ate, I looked out the window and saw people walking and jogging on the dirt path that ran past my house. After breakfast I went to the town square to meet my friend Jack. We had planned to go hunting together, and I was looking forward to the day’s adventure. The lack of wheels made transportation difficult, but people had adapted by walking or using animals. We walked through the forest, chatting and laughing, enjoying each other’s company. The trees towered above us, their leaves rustling in the gentle breeze. Jack suddenly stopped and motioned for me to be quiet. He pointed to a nearby tree, where a large buck was drinking from a stream. I nodded and we crept closer, trying not to startle the deer. Jack whistled softly, and the buck looked up, startled. But then, to our surprise, the deer began to approach us, curious about our presence. We stood there, not knowing what to do. When the deer was only a few feet away, Jack slowly reached out his hand and stroked the animal’s head. The deer nuzzled his hand, and Jack grinned at me. I couldn’t help but smile back. After a few minutes the deer wandered off, and we continued on our way. It was a strange and wonderful moment, one neither of us had ever experienced before. We walked for hours, enjoying the sights and sounds of nature, and when we finally returned to town we told our friends about our encounter with the deer. They were amazed. As the sun began to set, I realized how much I had enjoyed my day without the aid of technology.",

As I approached the counter, I noticed that the barista, a friendly lady with a warm smile, had written something on my cup. I couldn’t quite make out what it said, but it looked like the word “Run.” What did it mean? Was it a message from a secret admirer? My heart pounded with a mixture of confusion and curiosity. I took my coffee and quickly looked around to see if anyone was waiting for me outside, ready to sweep me off my feet and take me on a wild adventure. But the morning rush was in full swing, and no one was waiting for me. A cryptic message? Maybe it was just a prank, a playful remark about my frequent visits. After all, I was here almost every day. I took a sip of my coffee and tried to shake off the feeling that I was being watched. But what kind of action? Was I supposed to run down the street, dodging pedestrians and cars? As I walked out the door, the word “Run” seemed to resound in my mind, urging me to take action. The more I thought about it, the more my mind raced. Was it a call to action, a metaphor for pursuing my dreams and leaving my comfort zone behind? I took a detour through the park, lost in thought. The crisp autumn air and the sound of leaves crunching under my feet did little to clear my head. The word “Run” still lingered in my mind, taunting me. Finally, I found myself back at my desk, staring at the blank screen of my computer. I opened a new document and began to write, the words flowing like water. I wrote about the mysterious message on my cup, the thrill of the unknown, the feeling of being pushed forward. I wrote about the possibilities and the uncertainty, the excitement and the fear. As I wrote, the word “Run” began to take on a new meaning.",

The eyes in the mirror seemed to glow with a sickly light, and I could feel the power of the entity growing stronger, feel its icy breath on the back of my neck. “I am the one who will consume all in my path, who will leave nothing but destruction and despair in my wake.” “I am the one who will bring the end of days, the one who will bring humanity to its knees.” “I am the one who will bring eternal darkness, the one who will ensnare humanity in a never-ending cycle of terror and despair.” The mirror seemed to burst into flames, the fire spreading rapidly, engulfing everything in its path. The voice was like a cold, dark wind that howled through the room, chilling me to the bone. “I am the one who will bring the end of all things, the one who will bring eternal darkness and terror.” The voice grew even louder, a deafening, ear-splitting cacophony of sound that shook the very foundations of my soul. “I am the one who will burn the world to ashes, who will reduce it to a smoldering ruin.”",

It was addressed to someone named Mark, and it felt rather heavy for its size. I was both confused and worried. Inside were five vials filled with a strange liquid and a note that read, “Mark, these are the only antidotes. Good luck!” What kind of antidotes were these? And why were they addressed to someone named Mark? I decided to investigate further and began searching the Internet for clues. After a few minutes, I found a news article about a series of mysterious illnesses that had recently affected people in the area. The article mentioned that the illnesses were caused by an unknown virus, and that no cure had yet been found. Suddenly it dawned on me: the vials must contain the antidote to this virus! But why were they addressed to Mark? And how did they end up on my doorstep? I decided to check the package for more clues. I found a small label on the side of the package with a name and address that was not mine. It must have been the address of the intended recipient. I decided to contact the delivery company and ask them to help me find Mark. After a few minutes on hold, a customer service representative picked up. I explained the situation to her, and she told me that they would do their best to help me. She asked me to hold on while she checked. She finally came back to the line and gave me a phone number. “This is Mark’s number,” she said. “He’s been trying to track down the package for days.” I thanked her and hung up.",

Suddenly, a strange sensation was felt, as if the earth had tilted ever so slightly. The sun hung low on the horizon, its rays piercing the clouds. Then the sun began to disappear, replaced by a swirling vortex of colors. The people of the world gasped in wonder as the vortex grew larger and larger, filling the entire sky. The sky became a kaleidoscope of shapes and sounds. At the center of the vortex, a tiny point of light appeared, grew larger and larger, and finally became a brilliant star. The star glowed with an energy that seemed to come from another world, filling the air with an electric charge. The star began to take on a form, and the world watched in awe as it became a dazzling crystal palace, hanging in the sky. The palace shimmered and pulsed, as if alive. Then, without warning, the palace began to fall, slowly descending toward the earth. The world braced itself for impact, but instead of destruction, the palace landed softly, like a feather. People cautiously approached the palace, their fear replaced by curiosity. Inside, they found a series of interconnected domes, each filled with strange, glowing orbs.

The Xylophians immediately sent a diplomatic mission to Zythron-V, hoping to negotiate a peace treaty and prevent the weapon from being used. But the Zythronians were wary of outsiders and refused to let the Xylophians near their planet. The Xylophians began to build up their military defenses, knowing that if the Zythronians used their weapon, it would spell disaster for the entire galaxy.

They sent a fleet of warships to Xylophia-IV, hoping to cripple the Xylophians’ defenses and prevent them from interfering with their plans. But the Xylophians were ready for them. They had developed a powerful shield that could withstand even the most powerful attacks. The Zythronians’ fleet was destroyed and their weapon was destroyed in the battle. With their weapon destroyed, the Zythronians were forced to negotiate a peace treaty with the Xylophians.",

Sophia took the rabbit home and nursed it back to health. The rabbit was a magical creature, and it brought great joy to Sophia’s life. She named the rabbit Luna, and the two became inseparable friends. They spent their days together, wandering in the forest, playing games, and talking. But as time went by, Luna’s health began to fail. Despite Sophia’s best efforts, the rabbit’s condition grew worse, and it became clear that the rabbit would not live much longer. One day, Luna called Sophia to her side and said, “My time has come, my dear friend. I am grateful for the love and care you have given me, but now I must go.” Sophia was heartbroken. But she knew that she must let Luna go. As the rabbit took her last breath, Sophia felt a deep sadness that she had never known before. The world seemed to have stopped. But then something unexpected happened. Luna’s body began to glow, and a soft white light enveloped Sophia. The light grew brighter and brighter, and Sophia felt herself lifted up from the ground. In that moment, Sophia realized that Luna’s love and friendship had given her a new perspective on life. She had learned to appreciate the beauty and fragility of life, and to treasure every moment, no matter how brief. She looked up and saw Luna’s spirit rise up, radiant and free.",

The message read: “I am Satan, and I have come to claim your soul.” One night, Jack woke up to find Mr. Whiskers sitting on his chest, his eyes blazing red. At first, Jack thought it was just a silly joke, but as more and more strange things happened, he began to believe that Mr. Whiskers was indeed possessed by Satan. Mr. Whiskers would often stare at Jack with a piercing, eerie stare, and Jack could swear he heard the cat whispering Satanic verses under his breath. But Sarah refused to believe Jack’s claims, thinking he was just being paranoid. Jack was convinced that Mr. Whiskers was Satan’s minion. One day, he decided to set a trap for the cat, hoping to catch him in the act of evil. He set up a camera and waited for the cat to strike. And sure enough, when he checked the film, he saw Mr. Whiskers levitating in the air, his eyes blazing red. Convinced that he had finally caught Satan in the act, Jack called a priest to exorcise the demon from Mr. Whiskers. The priest arrived, armed with a crucifix and a flask of holy water, and began to chant, sprinkling holy water on the cat, who hissed and spat at him. The priest continued to chant, his voice growing louder and more urgent. To everyone’s surprise, Mr. Whiskers began to transform into a hideous, demonic creature. Jack and Sarah watched in horror as the cat’s body twisted and writhed. Then the creature that had once been Mr. Whiskers let out a shriek as it was cast back into hell.",

I had always been curious about my ancestors and where I came from. My ancestry was not at all what I had expected. As I scrolled through the results, my jaw dropped in shock. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I had always thought of myself as a normal human being, but now I began to question everything. Instead of the expected European or Asian heritage, my DNA revealed that I was actually a mixture of several extraterrestrial races. I felt as if I were living in a science-fiction movie. I decided to dig deeper into the results, and what I found was even more shocking. My ancestors were not just any ordinary aliens, but members of an advanced species. How could this be? How could I not have known this about myself? My mind was racing with questions and doubts. I couldn't believe that I was the product of this ancient interbreeding. As I continued to explore my results, I learned that my ancestors had come to Earth thousands of years ago and had lived among humans for generations. They had interbred with humans, and their DNA had been passed down to me through the generations. I decided to contact AncestryDNA to learn more, but they were tight-lipped about the whole thing. They told me that my results were not a mistake and that they had known about my extraterrestrial heritage all along. I couldn't wrap my head around it. How could they have known about this and not told me? I was filled with a mixture of emotions: shock, disbelief, and above all, deep wonder. I was stunned. I didn't know what to think about this new information. I had always felt that there was something different about me, but I had never imagined that it was this.",

When his colleagues spoke to him, he heard their voices as those of peasants and villagers, asking for his guidance and protection. He responded with kindness and wisdom, as any good knight would. He pictured himself in shining armor, his sword at his side, as he went about his daily tasks. When his boss came to see him, he saw him as the evil wizard Malice, trying to turn Sir Edward from his noble path. At meetings he imagined himself in a great council chamber, surrounded by other knights and the king’s advisers, discussing matters of state and war, and Sir Edward always had the best strategy. Throughout the day Sir Edward faced many challenges, from dragons to orcs to trolls, but he always emerged victorious, his honor and valor untarnished. But Sir Edward remained strong and steadfast, unwavering in his devotion to the king and the realm. As the sun set and Sir Thomas left the office, he felt sad. He missed the thrill of adventure and the respect of his fellow knights. But he knew that in his imagination he would always be Sir Edward, the brave knight.

He closed the door behind him and collapsed into his chair. The pain was a dull ache, a constant companion he had learned to live with. He opened his notebook and began to work. The words flowed from his fingers like water, a river of thought and creativity. The weight of his leg dragged him down, weighing him down. The hours flew by, a blur of words and ideas. The man's mind was sharp, his intelligence unmatched. He was a writer, a storyteller, and his work was his passion. The story he was writing was an adventure, a tale of heroes and villains, of love and loss. The man's leg ached, but he didn't notice. He was lost in his work, the world around him fading into the background. The words flowed like blood from a wound, a stream of consciousness pouring onto the page.

I tried to get rid of it, thinking that this was just my imagination, but my voice continued to echo in my heart. I tried to ignore it, but it was just getting bigger and more aggressive. I started to feel crazy, like being trapped in a nightmare that couldn't wake up. I walked everywhere, and I could hear the thoughts around them. All of them were thinking about my negative and harmful things. I tried to face people who I could hear, but they denied that thinking about such things. They looked at me, just like I was crazy, just like I was imagining. But I know what I heard is real. I became paranoid and isolated, afraid of leaving home because I was afraid of hearing more hurt ideas. I feel drowning in the negative ocean, and I don't know how to escape. However, one day, I heard different voices in my mind. This is a kind of good voice, saying encouragement and support. This is the voice of a friend. Even if I can't see it myself, I also see my best voice. This voice gave me hope. This made me realize that not everyone was thinking about my terrible things. Some people care about me and believe in me. I started to see the negative thoughts I heard, and they just thought of their reflection. This has nothing to do with me. It is about them and their own sense of insecurity and prejudice. I learned to prevent negative ideas and focus on positive ideas. I learned to trust myself and believe in myself, even if others do not. Slowly, but be sure, I started to get HE more. I started to feel like I am self -confident and capable. I learned to control my new discovery ability, and I can use it forever, not to make it consume me.",

The task is to write a short story in the future of the anti -Utopia, and human beings colonize other planets. The next hour, I spent the idea of brainstorming and outlined my story. I decided to set my story on a planet called Nova Haven, where humans have established a dim and oppressed colony. The protagonist is a young woman named Maya. She has always dreamed of escaping the earth and exploring the galaxy. She has worked as a technician on the large generator of the colonial site, which provides the only source of power for the settlement. One day, Maya found a hidden information in the code of the generator, which implied the existence of the secret spacecraft hidden deep in the crust. Determined to find the ship and escaped Nova Haven, Maya began to secretly formulate a plan. She knew that it was not easy because the colonies were severely protected and monitored by the government. The Maya collected materials and resources in the next few days, while avoiding the doubts of her colleagues and boss. She works unremittingly and often sacrifice sleep and dining to achieve her goals. In the end, the day when the Mayan was going to put her plan to practice.

However, adults smiled with confidence, \"Don't worry, this is just preventive measures.\" One night, a particularly curious child decided to conduct some investigations.

When they are deeper, they find that the surface of the earth is covered with thick high chloride, a salt that is poisonous to most life forms.

Specifically, I mean the law of gravity. The law pointed out that the objects of any two objects attract each other, and their strength is proportional to the product of quality, and it is inversely proportional to the distance between them. The actions of your organization blatantly ignore this law. Therefore, the environment, the community, and the entire planet have caused irreparable harm. I must emphasize that the law of gravity is not a artificial structure, but a natural phenomenon that controls the behavior of objects in the universe. Therefore, your organization must immediately take action to correct this situation and ensure that its activities meet the gravity law. I know that this may require major changes to your operations, but I assure you that the benefits of doing so far exceed any inconvenience or cost. Not only to abide by the law of gravity can help reduce the damage caused by your actions, but it will also bring a more sustainable and fair future to everyone. In addition, I want to remind you that ignoring the law of gravity is not only immoral, but also destroys the foundation of our society. As a responsible citizen, I urge you to take it seriously and immediately take action to solve this problem. I hope you will consider this issue carefully and take the necessary steps to ensure that your organization meets the law of gravity. Sincerely, [Your name]",

Was this real life, or was I trapped in a virtual reality? I scanned my room, searching for any clues. Everything looked so real, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it was all just a simulation. My memories were hazy; I couldn't even remember my name.I stood up and walked to the window. The view outside was breathtaking, but it could have been CGI for all I knew. I wondered if anyone else was in the same predicament as me. I decided to step outside and try to find some answers.As I walked down the street, I saw people going about their daily lives. They looked real, but how could I be sure? I approached a woman with a kind smile. \"Excuse me,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. \"Do you know if this is real life or VR?\"The woman looked at me with confusion. \"What do you mean? Of course, it's real life.\"I shook my head. \"I don't know. I can't seem to remember anything. How do I find out for sure?\"The woman's expression changed to one of sadness. \"You don't know? Oh, dear. I'm so sorry. There's only one way to find out for sure.\" She paused, taking a deep breath. \"If you die, you'll know that it was real life. But if you wake up again, it was just a simulation.\"My heart skipped a beat. That couldn't be true, could it? I thanked the woman and continued on my way. I had to find out for sure. I walked towards the nearest park, feeling a sense of dread building inside of me. I had to take the risk. I had to die.I climbed up a tall tree and jumped from a branch, feeling the rush of adrenaline as I plummeted towards the ground. Everything went black.When I woke up, I was back in my bedroom. The alarm was still blaring. It was all just a simulation. I sighed, feeling a mix of relief and disappointment.",

As they prepared their final report and recommendations for the Council of Preservation, they reflected on the duality of human nature - capable of both great good and terrible evil.The moderators, sent by a distant star system, had been tasked with monitoring the development of intelligent life on Earth. They had observed humans evolve from primitive hunter-gatherers to global superpowers, and in their report, they highlighted the species' capacity for both technological advancements and destructive tendencies.Throughout history, the moderators had witnessed humanity's darkest moments - wars, famines, and plagues that had decimated populations. But they had also seen the best of humanity - their insatiable curiosity, unwavering drive for knowledge, and their exploration of the cosmos.After much deliberation, the moderators reached a consensus: humanity was a fragile and flawed species, but one with immense potential. They proposed a series of tests, designed to assess humanity's ability to coexist peacefully with other intelligent species. If successful, the moderators believed that humanity would be worthy of joining the intergalactic community.The Council of Preservation reviewed the moderators' report and recommendations and decided to proceed with the tests. Seeing the potential in humanity, they were willing to give them a chance.The first test was a simple one: establishment of peaceful contact with a nearby alien species. The fate of humanity hung in the balance, as they embarked on this crucial journey. Would they prove themselves worthy of a place among the stars? Only time would tell.",

With trembling hands, I clicked on the link to discover the secrets my DNA held. As I scrolled through the results, my jaw dropped in disbelief. My ancestry was not at all what I had expected. Instead of European or Asian heritage, my DNA revealed that I was a mix of several extraterrestrial races.I couldn't believe it. How could this be possible? My mind raced with questions and doubts. How could I have never known this about myself?As I delved deeper into the results, I discovered that my ancestors weren't just any ordinary aliens, they were members of an advanced race of beings. It was like living in a science fiction movie.I reached out to AncestryDNA for more information, but they were tight-lipped about the whole thing. They told me that my results were not a mistake and that they had known about my extraterrestrial heritage all along.I was left with a mix of emotions: shock, disbelief, and above all, a deep sense of wonder.

As a scholar and priest, he had always been fascinated by the Papal archives, where centuries of historical records and secret documents were stored. When he was given the opportunity to delve into the archives and research a question that had long troubled him - why God had been absent from humanity for so long - he jumped at the chance.The archives were vast and labyrinthine, filled with dusty tomes and crumbling parchments that stretched back centuries. Father Antonio spent countless hours poring over ancient texts, searching for any clue that might shed light on his query. But as he delved deeper, he found himself becoming increasingly frustrated. There seemed to be no answer, no explanation for why God had abandoned humanity.It was on the seventh day of his research that Father Antonio made a startling discovery. Deep in the archives, he stumbled upon an ancient manuscript that had been hidden away for centuries. As he opened the cover, he realized that it was a firsthand account of the Black Death, the pandemic that had ravaged Europe in the 14th century.But as he read through the pages, Father Antonio began to notice something strange. The language used in the manuscript was unlike anything he had ever seen before. It was as if the author was describing something that had never been seen before, something that defied explanation.Suddenly, it hit him - the Black Death wasn't a pandemic at all. It was the Rapture. The author of the manuscript had been describing the moment when God came to claim his faithful, leaving behind only the wicked and the faithless.Father Antonio couldn't believe what he was reading. He had always been taught that the Rapture was a myth, a fanciful notion invented by heretics. But here it was, in black and white, described in detail by a contemporary of the event.",
